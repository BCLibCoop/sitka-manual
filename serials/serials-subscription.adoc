Serials Subscriptions
---------------------

The Serials Module can be used to create subscriptions, distributions, streams, and prediction patterns.  As well as to generate predictions and receive issues as they come in to the library.

To access the Serials Module, retrieve a bibliographic record, click on *Serials* -> *Manage Subscriptions*.  This will open the serials interface for that particular record.

Create and Manage Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A subscription must be added to a bibliographic record. If the record is not already in the catalogue, you can import it via any of your preferred methods (MARC import, Z39.50 search, etc.). A subscription is designed to hold all information related to a single serial title. Therefore, each library is likely to have only one subscription per serial title.

. Retrieve the bibliographic record you would like to attach your subscription to.
. Click *Serials* -> Choose *Manage Subscriptions*.
. Existing subscriptions for the workstation location will be displayed.
. Click *New Subscription*
