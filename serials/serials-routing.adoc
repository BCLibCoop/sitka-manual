Routing List
------------

Routing lists enable you to designate specific users and/or departments that serial items need to be routed to upon receiving.

Create a Routing List

To create a routing list for a subscription, go to the Manage Subscriptions tab for a serials record, select the subscription from the list and go to Actionsâ†’Additional Routing, or right-click and select Additional Routing. A dialog box will appear where you can create the routing list.

Scan or type in the barcode of the user the items should be routed to in the Reader (barcode) field and click Add Route. Continue adding barcodes until the list is complete.
To route items to a location, click the radio button next to Department, type in the routing location, and click Add Route.
A Note may be added along with each addition to the list.
The names and departments on the list will appear at the top of the dialog box and can be reordered by clicking the arrows or removed by clicking the x next to each name or department.
When the list is complete, click Update.
