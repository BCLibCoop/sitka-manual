Serials Binding
---------------

To bind received issues together:

. Go to the *Manage Issues* tab and select the issues you want to bind together.
. Right-click on the issues or go to *Action* and select *Bind*.
. The Bind Items interface will appear and all items will be represented on the screen. The first itemâ€™s fields will be editable.
. Modify the Call Number if needed.
. Replace the Barcode and click Save.

NOTE: The barcode must be replaced with a new barcode. The binding will fail if you attempt to reuse an existing barcode from one of the items being bound. Evergreen views it as a duplicate barcode.
