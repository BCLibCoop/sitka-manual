Preparing for an Inventory
--------------------------
(((Inventory)))

[NOTE]
======
The following guidelines and workflows have been developed by Co-op Support based on 
the functionality available in Sitka's Evergreen and the experience of inventory 
projects done by libraries in the Sitka consortium and the Evergreen community.
======

Inventory Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Inventory Date)))
(((Checkin Modifiers)))
(((Item Status)))
(((Holdings View)))


Item records include fields for inventory date and inventory workstation. The
values in these fields are updated when an item in inventoried by using the
*Update Inventory* action in _Item Status_ or the *Update Inventory* checkin 
modifier at _Check In_.

The inventory date and workstation can be seen in several places in the staff
client:

* Item Status - List View

* Item Status - Detail View Quick Summary Tab

+
* Bibliographic Record - Holdings View

[NOTE]
======
Due to a bug the inventory workstation in the Holdings View currently displays
the workstation database ID rather than the workstation name.

Assessing Your Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step to running inventory is to choose what you will inventory.  You may wish to inventory the entire
library collection or just plan on running inventory on specific collections.

If you plan to inventory the entire library collection Co-op Support recommends breaking it into sections, based
on shelving location and/or call number range.

There are several report templates you can use to aid you in preparing for your inventory.

* Sitka_templates -> Collection -> Item and Title Count -> 
xref:_title_amp_item_count_by_shelving_location_and_circulation_modifier[Title & 
Item Count by Shelving Location & Circulation Modifier]
+
** This template will give a report showing the make up of your entire collection by shelving location & circulation
modifier.  The report can be helpful in determining which sections of the collection you would like to inventory when.
+
* Sitka_templates -> Collection -> Item List by Item Attributes -> Shelving Location : 
Items with Selected Shelving Location
+
** This template will give a report that lists all items in a particular shelving location. This can be helpful
to show what should be on the shelf.
+
* Sitka_templates -> Collection -> Item List by Item Attributes -> 
Call Number : Items with Call Numbers within a Range
+
** This template will give a report that lists all items in your sepecified call number range.  This can be helpful to 
break up large shelving locations, like Fiction and Non-Fiction, into smaller pieces.


Initial Set Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inventory Start Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make a note of the date you start inventory.  You will need this when running 
reports later in the process.

Report Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Reports, Inventory)))

There are two report templates used with inventory - 
xref:_inventory_un_scanned_items[_Inventory - Un-scanned Items_] and 
xref:_inventory_scanned_items_count_by_shelving_location[_Inventory - 
Scanned Items Count by Shelving Location_]. Both templates can be found under 
Sitka_templates -> Inventory.

Make sure you have the most recent version of the templates cloned into your own folders.
For information on cloning report templates see xref:_cloning_a_report_template[].


Columns
^^^^^^^
[_inventory_columns]
(((Columns, Inventory)))

Best practice is to ensure that the Check In and Item Status screens are set to
display the call number, shelving location, and circulation modifier xref:_columns[columns].

As items are scanned for inventory staff should keep an eye out for the following:

* incorrect call numbers
* call numbers not matching between Evergreen and the item
* incorrect shelving locations
* incorrect circulation modifiers
* missing circulation modifiers

Items found with one of the above issues should be pulled so staff with cataloguing 
permissions can update the items as needed.  


Update Inventory Checkin Modifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[_update_inventory_checkin_modifier]
(((Update, Inventory Date)))

Turn on the _Update Inventory_ checkin modifier on all computers where items may be checked
in while you are doing inventory.  This ensures that any items currently circulating 
will have their inventory date updated when they are checked in.

. In Evergreen, go to **Circulation -> Check In**.
. From the _Checkin Modifiers_ drop down select **Update Inventory**.

. A banner will display across the top of the check in screen to indicate that the _Update
Inventory_ modifier is being used.
