Creating Bookable Non-Bibliographic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staff with the required permissions can create bookable non-bibliographic resources such as laptops, projectors, and meeting rooms.

The following pieces make up a non-bibliographic resource:

* Resource Type
* Resource Attribute
* Resource Attribute Values
* Resource
* Resource Attribute Map

[NOTE]
You need to create *Resource Types* and *Resource Attributes*, and add *Resources* (booking items) to individual resource types. Each resource attribute may have multiple values. You need to link the applicable features (resource attributes and values) to individual items (resource) through the *Resource Attribute Map*. Before you create resources (booking items) you need to have a resource type and associated resource attributes and values, if any, for them.

Create New Resource Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Select *Administration* -> *Booking Administration* -> *Resource Types*.

. A list of current resource types will appear.

.. You may also see cataloged items in the list. Those items have been marked bookable or booked before.

. To create a new resource type, click *New Resource Type* in the top right corner, .

. Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
A resource may have multiple attributes and values. Repeat the above steps to map all.


Editing Non-Bibliographic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staff with the required permissions can edit aspects of existing non-bibliographic resources. For example, resource type can be edited in the event that the fine amount for a laptop changes from $2.00 to $5.00.

Editing Resource Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Bring up your list of resource types. Select *Administration* -> *Booking Administration* -> *Resource Types*.

. A list of current resource types will appear.

. Double click anywhere on the line of the resource type you would like to edit.

. The resource type box will appear. Make your changes and click *Save*.

. Following the same procedure you may edit Resource Attributes, Attributes Values, Resources and Attribute Map by selecting them on *Administration* -> *Booking Administration*.


Deleting Non-bibliographic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. To delete a booking resource, go to *Administration* -> *Booking Administration* -> *Resources*.

. Select the check box in front the resource you want to delete.

. Click *Delete Selected*. The resource will disappear from the list.

[NOTE]
Following the same procedure you may delete Resource Attributes Maps.

You may also delete Resource Attribute Values, Resource Attributes and Resource Types. But you have to delete them in the reverse order when you create them to make sure the entry is not in use when you try to delete it.

This is the deletion order: Resource Attribute Map/Resources -> Resource Attribute Values -> Resource Attributes -> Resource Types.
