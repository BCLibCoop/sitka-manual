Keyword Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Keyword Search tab is generally not used when searching for records for cataloguing.  Libraries that
catalogue non-bibliographic items (laptops, museum passes, cake pans, etc.) that don't use standard identifiers,
like ISBN, may need to use the Keyword Search when adding additional items to these records.

. To search the catalogue for holdings select *Cataloging* -> *Search the Catalog (Experimnental)*.

. When searching for cataloguing purposes it is important to ensure 
that you search the entire consortium.
