[TIP]
======
* It is possible to search ISBNs by Keyword, but results may not be exhaustive. We recommend using *Numeric Search* as described above.

* If an OCLC number is nine digits then Evergreen uses ocn as a prefix. For example:  ocn123456789.

* If an OCLC number is less than 8 digits then Evergreen uses ocm as a prefix.  In addition Evergreen will automatically prefix the number with zeros so that it is nine digits.  For example:  ocm01234567, or ocm00123456.

* If searching a LCCN do not use a hyphen,  add a 0 in place of a hyphen, e.g. 2001001234.
