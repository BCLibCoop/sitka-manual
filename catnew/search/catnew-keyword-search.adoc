Keyword Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When searching the catalogue for cataloguing purposes the Numeric Search should be preferred over the Keyword Search.
Libraries that catalogue non-bibliographic items (laptops, museum passes, cake pans, etc.) that don't use standard 
identifiers, like ISBN, may need to use the Keyword Search when adding additional items to these records.

. To search the catalogue for holdings select *Cataloging* -> *Search the Catalog (Experimnental)*.
