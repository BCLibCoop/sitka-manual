It is critical to search the database before adding titles, volumes, or copies. Good practice is to assume the item you are adding already exists, 
and to do an exhaustive search for the item before cataloguing it. By doing so, you will discover whether you need to add your item to an existing 
title record, or if you need to import or create a new title record. It is very important that you scope your cataloguing searches to the entire 
Sitka database.

.To search the experimental catalogue:
. Go to *Cataloguing* ->  *Search the Catalog (Experimental)*.
