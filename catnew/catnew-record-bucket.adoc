Record Buckets
--------------

Record buckets allow you to build a list of titles that you may process in batch. It is also the interface for merging records. Records, even after being deleted, remain in a bucket until they are removed from it.

We will demonstrate how to create and manage bibliographic record buckets.  It is very important when working with buckets to ensure you are working with the correct type of record for the corresponding bucket. You cannot add copy records to bibliographic record buckets and vice versa.

Creating Record Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to create a record bucket. You can either create a bucket first, without accessing any records, or you can access a record and choose to create the bucket from that view. We will demonstrate both methods here.

*Creating a Record Bucket on Record Buckets* view

. Select *Cataloging -> Record Buckets* from the menu bar.

. Select *New Bucket* from the *Buckets* dropdown list.

. The newly created bucket is the active bucket in Bucket View.  Note that the bucket is numbered, and creating owner identified.

. Click the *Buckets* dropdown list, you will see the bucket on the list. You can edit the bucket's name or description by clicking on *Edit Bucket* on the list.

=====
Only buckets created by the login account are listed. But those created by other people can be retrieved via bucket number, if shared with you. Click *Shared Bucket* to type in the number to retrieve it.

*Creating a Record Bucket when Adding a Record to a Bucket*

You can also create a bucket from within a record.

. Search for, retrieve, and display any bibliographic record, then choose *Other Actions -> Add to Bucket*.

. You are prompted to add the record to an existing bucket or to a new one. To add to a new bucket, type in a name in *Name For New Bucket* box, then click *Add to New Bucket*.

Adding Records to a Record Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add records to a bucket in a few places.

*Adding Records to a Bucket on the Catalogue*

Once you retrieve a record on the catalogue, select *Other Actions -> Add to Bucket* to add it to a record bucket.

*Add Records to a Bucket on Record Bucket View*

You can run a search, then select records from the result list to add to a bucket on Record Bucket view.

. Go to Record Bucket by choosing *Cataloguing -> Record Bucket*.
. Create or select a bucket by using the *Buckets* dropdown list on Bucket View tab now or later.
. Click *Record Query*

. You can continue to search for more records and add them to the Pending tab or the Bucket. Once done, you may go *Bucket View* to create or select a bucket, if not done yet. You can select, then add records, on Pending Records tab, if any, to a bucket.

Working with Records in a Record Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply the following functions to selected records in a bucket.

* *Show Selected Records in Catalogue*
* *Delete Selected Records from Catalogue*
* *Merge Selected Records* (Refer to xref:_merging_bibliographic_records[])
* *Export Records* (Refer to xref:export-marc-from-bucket[])


To apply these functions, retrieve the bucket, select titles, then choose the function from the *Actions* list.
