Adding Holdings for Non-physical Resources in the Experimental Catalogue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to catalogue non-physical resources in Evergreen. Our recommended process is 
to use specially coded MARC records as described in xref:cataloguing_nonphysical_resources[]. 

Alternatively you may add placeholder holdings to a MARC record.

* Use the same steps as adding physical holdings as described in the prior section.
* It is important to use item barcodes from within your designated barcode range. 
* Placeholder holdings will scope your non-physical resources to your public catalogue.
