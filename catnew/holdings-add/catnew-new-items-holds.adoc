New Items and Holds in the Experimental Catalogue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Re-target Holds)))
(((New Items)))

Because of the way Evergreen targets holds, new items are not guaranteed to fulfill pre-existing holds until 
24 hours after cataloguing. If you are a single branch library and your cataloguing turn-around 
time is shorter than 24 hours you can ensure the new item is captured at check in by using 
the checkin modifiers *Retarget Local Holds* and *Retarget All Statuses*.

As the checkin modifiers will only re-target the top local hold, which may not be the top system hold, 
multi-branch libraries should instead follow the procedure below.

. After adding the item, click on *View Holds*.

. If there are outstanding hold requests, select the hold that is next in line then click  
the actions button and choose *Find Another Target*. This forces Evergreen to re-target the hold 
and recognize the newly catalogued item.

. Check in the new item to capture it for the selected hold.
