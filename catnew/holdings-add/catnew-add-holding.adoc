.. Currently the default Owning and Circulating Library of the item will always be the location of the workstation.  Future
development is expected to return the ability for multi-branch libraries to select a branch in *Holdings View*
and have it be used for the Owning and Circulating Library.

. Complete the required fields in both the call number and item records. 
Refer to xref:_working_on_item_attributes[] for information about individual fields 
in an item record. To ensure data consistency, using holdings templates is recommended.
