Long term the current staff catalogue will be replaced with an updated, designed for the web client, catalogue.  Libraries can choose to turn 
on the experimental catalogue and start getting familiar with the changes.  The experimental catalogue is not yet fully featured so 
some tasks will still need to be completed in the current catalogue.

Enable the Experimental Catalogue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A local system administrator at you library can enable the experimental catalogue.

. Go to *Administration → Local Administration → Library Setting Editor*.
. Find the setting _GUI:Enable Experimental Angular Staff Catalog_ and set it to _True_.
. Both the current catalogue and the experimental catalogue will display as options in the Cataloguing drop down menu.
