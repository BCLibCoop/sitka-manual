Course Reserves Administration
------------------------------

The Course Reserves module is available to academic libraries for displaying and managing course 
reserve lists.  

The module uses the My Lists functionality in the public catalogue to create lists of 
reserves materials that can be viewed by users.

Implementing Course Reserves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To request the course reserves module for your library
 https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[contact Support].  This module is only available for academic
 libraries.
 
Before implementing course reserves you will need to consider the following:

**How will your reserve items will be identified in Evergreen?**

Support recommends setting up a Course Reserves shelving location and using reserve specific
modifiers.

**How will your reserve items circulate?**

If your reserve materials will have special loan periods or fines you will need to consider which circulation
modifiers you use and contact Support to set up new circulation policies.  If reserve materials
are not holdable your shelving location needs to be set accordingly or hold policies adjusted by Support.

**Who will create the course reserve lists?**

Because the course reserves module uses the My Lists functionality the lists can be created by 
instructors or library staff or both.  Decide who will create the lists and how admin staff
will be informed of new lists to be added or old lists needing to be removed.
