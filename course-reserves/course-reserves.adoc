Implementing Course Reserves
----------------------------

Before implementing course reserves you will need to consider the following:

**How will your reserve items will be identified in Evergreen?**

Co-op Support recommends setting up course reserves related shelving locations and using reserve specific
circulation modifiers.

**How will your reserve items circulate?**

If your reserve materials will have special loan periods or fines you will need to consider which circulation
modifiers you use and contact Co-op Support to set up new circulation policies.  If reserve materials
are not holdable your applicable shelving locations needs to be set accordingly or hold policies 
adjusted by Support.

**Who will have access to course reserves?**

Library staff must have cataloguing permissions in order to use the course reserves module
as the module can update item attributes.

Course Reserves Library Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three library settings for the course reserves module.
Local administrators can update the values for two of them by going to 
*Administration ->Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor* and finding the relevant setting.

* _Opt Org Unit into the Course Materials Module_
** Set this to TRUE to have course reserves 
functionality display in the public catalogue.
* _Allow users to browse Courses by Instructor_
** Some libraries may associate
many of their courses with their instructors.  Some may not associate any of
their courses with an instructor, or the instructor data may be inconsistent.
A TRUE value for this setting is appropriate for libraries that have
consistent instructor data and want to allow patrons to locate courses in
the public catalogue via instructor name.
* _Bib source for brief records created in the course materials module_
** This is set to 
_Course materials module_ for all Sitka libraries.
The course materials module will use this bib source for any new brief
bibliographic records made inside that module. A transcendant bib source is
likely preferable here, as it would allow an electronic resource to display
in the public catalog without adding any items or located URIs.


Course Reserves Administration
------------------------------

To access the course reserves module go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List*.

Creating Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may optionally keep track of your institutions terms or semesters.

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List*.
. Click on the *Terms* tab.
. Click "Create Term".

+
. Enter the name of the term.
. If you are a multi-branch library you may need to change the owning library to be your system, rather than
a particular branch.
. Enter a start date and an end date for the term.
. Click *Save*.

Modifying course roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen users can be associated with courses in various roles.  For example,
one Evergreen user may be associated as the instructor of a course, while others
are associated as students in the course.

Course roles are shared across the entire Evergreen installation, rather than
being specific to a specific library.

To modify course roles:

. Navigate to Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List.
. Open the Course roles tab.
. When modifying course roles, be very careful about whether or not they are
_OPAC Viewable_.  Having an instructor role viewable in the OPAC could be very
beneficial, as it could enable students to locate their course using the name
of their instructor.  However, having a student role viewable in the OPAC could
be a violation of the students' privacy rights, as it would expose their course
registration to the general public.

Creating Courses

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List*.
. The *Course list* tab will open by default.
. Click *Create Course*.

Associating Materials With a Course
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. In the course, click on the *Course materials* tab.
. Three types of materials can be associated with a course:
** xref:associate-item[Catalogued Items]
** xref:associate-brief-record[Brief Records]
** xref:associate-electronic-resource[Electronic Resources]

[[associate-item]]
Associating an Item
+++++++++++++++++++

. On the *Course materials* tab, the *Associate item* tab will open by default.
. Enter the barcode of the item you wish to associate with the course.

- You may optionally describe the relationship of the item to the course.  For
example, the item may be "required reading" or "optional listening".
- If necessary, you may temporarily change various characteristics of the item
while attaching it.  For example, if you are bringing a book from your typical
stacks to the reserves room, you may wish to change the book's shelving location,
circulation modifier, and call number.  The characteristics will remain in effect
until the item is detached from the course or the course is archived.
- Press the "Add material" button.

[[associate-brief-record]]
Associating a Brief Record
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These procedures are intended if you wish to attach a resource to a course,
and the resource is not in your catalog.

- Navigate to Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List
- Select an existing course.
- Choose Edit Selected from the Actions menu.
- Open the Course materials tab.
- Open the "Associate brief record" tab.
- Fill out the metadata for the resource.
- You may optionally describe the relationship of the resource to the course.
- Press the "Add material" button.

After creating a brief record, it is represented as a bibliographic record in
your catalog, which catalogers may edit and enhance at any time.  When the resource
is detached from the course or the course is archived, the bibliographic record
will be automatically deleted.

[[associate-electronic-resource]]
Associating an Electronic Resource
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These procedures are intended if you wish to attach a resource to a course,
and the resource is an electronic resource in your catalog.  An example of
this type of resource is a library-licensed ebook that is used as a course
textbook.

- In the staff catalog, find the electronic resource that you would like to
add. In the record summary, note the Database ID.
- Navigate to Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List
- Select an existing course.
- Choose Edit Selected from the Actions menu.
- Open the Course materials tab.
- Open the "Associate electronic resource from catalog" tab.
- Enter the resource's bibliographic ID.
- You may optionally describe the relationship of the resource to the course.
- Press the "Add material" button.

Unlike brief records, detaching this resource from the course or archiving the
course will not delete the bibliographic record.
