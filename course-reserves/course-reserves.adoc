Implementing Course Reserves
----------------------------

Before implementing course reserves you will need to consider the following:

**How will your reserve items will be identified in Evergreen?**

Co-op Support recommends setting up course reserves related shelving locations and using reserve specific
circulation modifiers.

**How will your reserve items circulate?**

If your reserve materials will have special loan periods or fines you will need to consider which circulation
modifiers you use and contact Co-op Support to set up new circulation policies.  If reserve materials are 
not holdable, your applicable shelving locations will need to be set accordingly, or, your hold 
policies will have to be adjusted by Co-op Support.

**Who will have access to course reserves?**

Library staff must have cataloguing permissions in order to use the course reserves module
as the module can update item attributes.

To enable the course reserves module in your public catalogue:

. Go to *Administration ->Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor*
. Set the library setting _Opt Org Unit into the Course Materials Module_ to TRUE
. There will now be options for searching and browsing course reserves in the public catalogue.


Course Reserves Administration
------------------------------

To access the course reserves module go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List*.

Modifying course roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen users can be associated with courses in various roles.  For example,
one Evergreen user may be associated as the instructor of a course, while others
are associated as students in the course.

Course roles are shared across the entire Evergreen installation, rather than
being specific to a specific library.

To modify course roles:

. Navigate to Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List.
. Open the Course roles tab.
. When modifying course roles, be very careful about whether or not they are
_OPAC Viewable_.  Having an instructor role viewable in the OPAC could be very
beneficial, as it could enable students to locate their course using the name
of their instructor.  However, having a student role viewable in the OPAC could
be a violation of the students' privacy rights, as it would expose their course
registration to the general public.
