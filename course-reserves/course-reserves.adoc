Implementing Course Reserves
----------------------------

Before implementing course reserves you will need to consider the following:

**How will your reserve items will be identified in Evergreen?**

Co-op Support recommends setting up course reserves related shelving locations and using reserve specific
circulation modifiers.

**How will your reserve items circulate?**

If your reserve materials will have special loan periods or fines you will need to consider which circulation
modifiers you use and contact Co-op Support to set up new circulation policies.  If reserve materials
are not holdable your applicable shelving locations needs to be set accordingly or hold policies 
adjusted by Support.

**Who will have access to course reserves?**

Library staff must have cataloguing permissions in order to use the course reserves module
as the module can update item attributes.

Course Reserves Library Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three library settings for the course reserves module.
Local administrators can update the values for two of them by going to 
*Administration ->Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor* and finding the relevant setting.

* _Opt Org Unit into the Course Materials Module_
** Set this to TRUE to have course reserves 
functionality display in the public catalogue.
* _Allow users to browse Courses by Instructor_
** Some libraries may associate
many of their courses with their instructors.  Some may not associate any of
their courses with an instructor, or the instructor data may be inconsistent.
A TRUE value for this setting is appropriate for libraries that have
consistent instructor data and want to allow patrons to locate courses in
the public catalogue via instructor name.
* _Bib source for brief records created in the course materials module_
** This is set to 
_Course materials module_ for all Sitka libraries.
The course materials module will use this bib source for any new brief
bibliographic records made inside that module. A transcendant bib source is
likely preferable here, as it would allow an electronic resource to display
in the public catalog without adding any items or located URIs.


Course Reserves Administration
------------------------------

To access the course reserves module go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List*.

Creating Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may optionally keep track of your institutions terms or semesters.

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List*.
. Click on the *Terms* tab.
. Click "Create Term".

+
. Enter the name of the term.
. If you are a multi-branch library you may need to change the owning library to be your system, rather than
a particular branch.
. Enter a start date and an end date for the term.
. Click *Save*.

Modifying course roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen users can be associated with courses in various roles.  For example,
one Evergreen user may be associated as the instructor of a course, while others
are associated as students in the course.

Course roles are shared across the entire Evergreen installation, rather than
being specific to a specific library.

To modify course roles:

. Navigate to Administration -> Local Administration -> Course Reserves List.
. Open the Course roles tab.
. When modifying course roles, be very careful about whether or not they are
_OPAC Viewable_.  Having an instructor role viewable in the OPAC could be very
beneficial, as it could enable students to locate their course using the name
of their instructor.  However, having a student role viewable in the OPAC could
be a violation of the students' privacy rights, as it would expose their course
registration to the general public.

collection.
** xref:associate-electronic-resource[Electronic resources] from your collection.
