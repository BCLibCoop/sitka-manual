Downloading and Installing Hatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hatch is an *optional* installable program that works with your browser to manage complex printing needs, such as printing to different printers under different circumstances.

anchor:download-hatch-ref[Hatch]
. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
Windows only requires a JRE to run Hatch, not a full JDK. Download and install JRE version 1.8 or higher from https://www.java.com[java].

. Install Hatch from https://evergreen-ils.org/downloads/Hatch-Installer-0.1.5.exe[Hatch]

. Install Chrome extension. If the extension was not installed automatically when installing Hatch you can get it directly in the browser from the Chrome App Store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hatch-native-messenger/ppooibdipmklfichpmkcgplfgdplgahl[Chrome App Store]

Enable Hatch in Evergreen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set Search Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Go to *Administration* -> *Workstation*.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate *Default Search Library*.
.. The default search library setting determines what library is searched from the advanced search screen and portal page by default. You can override this setting when you are actually searching by selecting a different library. One recommendation is to set the search library to the highest point you would normally want to search.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate *Preferred Library*.
.. The preferred library is used to show copies and electronic resource URIs regardless of the library searched. One recommendation is to set this to your home library so that local copies show up first in search results.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate *Advanced Search Default Pane*.
.. Advanced search has secondary panes for Numeric and MARC Expert searching. You can change which one is loaded by default when opening a new catalog window here.
