Column Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From many screens and lists, you can click on the column picker drop-down menu to change which columns
are displayed. Various search results tables may not default to the most useful columns. For instance,
the patron search results page may be easier to use if you change the columns to Card, Last Name,
First Name, Middle Name, and Primary Identification, and you may wish to have the results sort
by Last Name, then by First Name.

.To customize your columns:
. Click on the dropdown arrow or the settings symbol on the function bar to open the column picker.
.. Some options in the menu and the resulting screens will differ depending on the version of the function bar.
+

Filters
~~~~~~~

Some interfaces now include filters that enable staff to filter the available rows.

image::images/intro/filters-1.png[]

Depending on the data in the field the filters will either allow you to filter on true/false or the text values.

image::images/intro/filters-2.png[]


image::images/intro/filters-3.png[]

When a column is filtered it will display with a blue Filter that can be edited to change the value of the filter.
Filters can be removed individually per column by clearing the filter or all filters can be removed at once
using the *Remove Filters* button.

[[download-hatch]]
Downloading and Installing Hatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hatch is an *optional* installable program that works with your browser to manage complex printing needs, such as printing to different printers under different circumstances.

anchor:download-hatch-ref[Hatch]

. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
Windows only requires a JRE to run Hatch, not a full JDK. Download and install JRE version 1.8 or higher from https://www.java.com[java].

. Install Hatch from https://evergreen-ils.org/downloads/Hatch-Installer-0.3.2.exe[Hatch]

. Install Chrome extension. If the extension was not installed automatically when installing Hatch you can get it directly in the browser from the Chrome App Store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hatch-native-messenger/ppooibdipmklfichpmkcgplfgdplgahl[Chrome App Store]

Enable Hatch in Evergreen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Log into Evergreen as LSA.

. Click *Administration -> Workstation*.

. Click *Print Service ('Hatch')*

. Make sure that you see that Hatch is available. Select *Use Hatch For Printing* .

. Log out. Print preferences will now be stored in Hatch.

Refer to xref:hatch-printing[] to configure printer settings.

Refer to xref:hatch-troubleshooting[] if you are having issues with Hatch.

[[set-search-pref]]
Set Search Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Go to *Administration* -> *Workstation*.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate *Default Search Library*.
.. The default search library setting determines what library is searched from the advanced search screen and portal page by default. You can override this setting when you are actually searching by selecting a different library. One recommendation is to set the search library to the highest point you would normally want to search.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate *Preferred Library*.
.. The preferred library is used to show copies and electronic resource URIs regardless of the library searched. One recommendation is to set this to your home library so that local copies show up first in search results.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate *Advanced Search Default Pane*.
.. Advanced search has secondary panes for Numeric and MARC Expert searching. You can change which one is loaded by default when opening a new catalog window here.
