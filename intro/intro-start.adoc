~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[browser-defaults]]

[[bookmarks-profiles]]
Bookmarks and Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The web client allows you to bookmark the pages that you use the most, and to use your browser's existing functionality to build your own custom toolbars and even to use browser profiles for different activities.

[[tab-buttons-keyboard-shortcuts]]
Tab Buttons and Keyboard Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that the client will be loaded in a web browser, users can use browser-based tab controls and keyboard shortcuts to help with navigation. Below are some tips for browser navigation that can be used in Chrome on Windows PCs.

.Keyboard Shortcuts
* Use CTRL-T or click the browser’s new tab button to open a new tab.
* Use CTRL-W or click the x in the tab to close the tab.
* Undo closing a tab by hitting CTRL-Shift-Tab.
* To open a link from the web client in a new tab, CTRL-click the link or right-click the link and select Open Link in New Tab. Using this method, you can also open options from the web client’s dropdown menus in a new tab
* Navigate from one tab to another using CTRL-Tab on the keyboard.

Setting New Tab Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Some users may want to automatically open the web client’s portal page in a new tab. Chrome will not open your home page by default when you open a new tab. However, optional add-ons will allow you to set the browsers to automatically open the home page whenever open opening a new tab. These add-ons may be useful for those libraries that want the new tab to open to the web client portal page.

Column Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From many screens and lists, you can click on the column picker drop-down menu to change which columns are displayed. Various search results tables may not default to the most useful columns. For instance, the patron search results page may be easier to use if you change the columns to Card, Last Name, First Name, Middle Name, Dob, and Primary Identification, and you may wish to have the results sort by Last Name, then by First Name.

.To customize your columns:
. Click on the dropdown arrow at the top-right of the results table.
. Select the desired columns.
. Click 'Save Columns' (on the dropdown list).
. Click 'Configure columns' (on the dropdown list).
. Use Expand and Shrink to change column sizes.
. Use Left and Right to change the column order.
. Use the sort options to prioritize how sorting should work. (A negative number will sort the column in reverse order.)
. Click 'Save columns.'

[[download-hatch]]
Downloading and Installing Hatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

anchor:download-hatch-ref[Hatch]
. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
Windows only requires a JRE to run Hatch, not a full JDK. Download and install JRE version 1.8 or higher from https://www.java.com[java].

. Install Hatch from https://evergreen-ils.org/downloads/Hatch-Installer-0.1.5.exe[Hatch]

. Install Chrome extension. If the extension was not installed automatically when installing Hatch you can get it directly in the browser from the Chrome App Store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hatch-native-messenger/ppooibdipmklfichpmkcgplfgdplgahl[Chrome App Store]

Enable Hatch in Evergreen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Log into Evergreen as LSA.

. Click *Administration -> Workstation*.

. Click *Print/Storage Service ('Hatch')*

. Make sure that you see that Hatch is available. Click *Use Hatch For Printing*, *Store Local Settings in Hatch*, and *Store Offline Transaction Data in Hatch*.

. Click *Copy Local Storage Settings To Hatch*.

. Log out. Preferences will now be stored in Hatch. This will enable you to clear your browser settings and not lose your staff preferences .

Set Search Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Go to *Administration* -> *Workstation*.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate Default Search Library.
.. The default search library setting determines what library is searched from the advanced search screen and portal page by default. You can override this setting when you are actually searching by selecting a different library. One recommendation is to set the search library to the highest point you would normally want to search.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate Preferred Library.
.. The preferred library is used to show copies and electronic resource URIs regardless of the library searched. One recommendation is to set this to your home library so that local copies show up first in search results.
. Use the dropdown menu to select an appropriate Advanced Search Default Pane.
.. Advanced search has secondary panes for Numeric and MARC Expert searching. You can change which one is loaded by default when opening a new catalog window here.
