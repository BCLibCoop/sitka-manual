The web client allows you to bookmark the pages that you use the most, and to use your browser's existing functionality to build your own custom toolbars and even to use browser profiles for different activities.

Tab Buttons and Keyboard Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that the client will be loaded in a web browser, users can use browser-based tab controls and keyboard shortcuts to help with navigation. Below are some tips for browser navigation that can be used in Chrome on Windows PCs.

.Keyboard Shortcuts
* Use *CTRL-T* or click the browser’s new tab button to open a new tab.
* Use *CTRL-W* or click the x in the tab to close the tab.
* Undo closing a tab by hitting *CTRL-Shift-Tab*.
* To open a link from the web client in a new tab, *CTRL-click* the link or *right-click the link and select Open Link in New Tab*. Using this method, you can also open options from the web client’s dropdown menus in a new tab
* Navigate from one tab to another using *CTRL-Tab* on the keyboard.

Setting New Tab Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Some users may want to automatically open the web client’s portal page in a new tab. Chrome will not open your home page by default when you open a new tab. However, optional add-ons will allow you to set the browsers to automatically open the home page whenever open opening a new tab. These add-ons may be useful for those libraries that want the new tab to open to the web client portal page.
