The web client allows you to bookmark the pages that you use the most, and to use your browser's existing functionality to build your own custom toolbars and even to use browser profiles for different activities.

Tab Buttons and Keyboard Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As the staff client is loaded in a web browser, library staff can use browser-based tab controls and keyboard shortcuts to help with navigation. Below are some tips for browser navigation that can be used in Chrome on Windows PCs.

.Keyboard Shortcuts
* Use *CTRL-T* or click the browser’s new tab button to open a new tab.
* Use *CTRL-W* or click the x in the tab to close the tab.
* Undo closing a tab by hitting *CTRL-Shift-Tab*.
* To open a link from the web client in a new tab, *CTRL-click* the link or *right-click the link and select Open Link in New Tab*. Using this method, you can also open options from the web client’s dropdown menus in a new tab
* Navigate from one tab to another using *CTRL-Tab* on the keyboard.

Setting New Tab Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Some users may want to automatically open the web client’s portal page in a new tab. Chrome will not open your home page by default when you open a new tab. However, optional add-ons will allow you to set the browsers to automatically open the home page whenever open opening a new tab. These add-ons may be useful for those libraries that want the new tab to open to the web client portal page.

Clear Cookies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you log in and see a blank page with the green bar across the top, but nothing else will load, you may need to clear your browser's cache and cookies.

////
CAUTION: Before you clear cookies, be aware that clearing cookies will cause you to lose your registered workstations and local settings if they are still stored on the browser. As of Evergreen 3.3 these settings are stored on the Sitka server, and they have to be moved from browser to server manually. Clearing cookies, and subsequently reconfiguring local settings in Evergreen, will manually save settings to the Sitka server by default, and then clearing browser cookies will no longer be a concern for local settings. It is important to remember your workstation name.  Your workstation settings and preferences are stored on Sitka's Evergreen server with your workstation name.  If you rename your workstation you will lose your stored settings and preferences.
