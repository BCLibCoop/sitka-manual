New Behaviour in Evergreen 3.0
------------------------------
New Web Staff Client (Web Client)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sitka's new Evergreen web client is accessed, in the internet browser Chrome, at catalogue.libraries.coop/eg/staff/login.

Sitka's new Evergreen web client is only supported in Chrome. You must use Chrome to login to Evergreen.

Workstations will have to be registered the first time you access the new staff URL, and you must be an Evergreen Local System Administrator (LSA) to register workstations.
All existing staff logins will work once a workstation is registered.

Hatch , available at xxxxxx, must be installed to print and to manage local settings.
Co-op Support recommends all Sitka libraries install and configure Hatch.

You will notice the new web client looks and functions very similar to familiar workflows. Menus and choices are consistent, with the added bonus of navigating and configuring Evergreen using modern browser functionality.
