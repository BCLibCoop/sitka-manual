(((Workstation Registration)))
(((Registering, Workstation)))

https://youtu.be/GsZj_3YBVRM[*Sitka Snippet Video - Register Workstation (2:06)*]

Every computer used with Sitka's Evergreen for staff functions must have at least
one registered workstation.

Staff will be prompted to register a workstation if:

* this is the first time the computer/browser has been used with Sitka's Evergreen.
* they are logging into a different server, such as Co-op Support's 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/training-server/[training server].
* the cookies for the browser have been cleared.


[NOTE]
======
Only local system administrator staff accounts can register workstations.
======

. Navigate to the web client log in page. The URL to log into the staff client is *https://catalogue.libraries.coop/eg/staff/*
. Enter a local system administrator username and password.
. Click *Sign In*
+
image::images/intro/register-workstation-1.png[]
+
. You will be prompted to register a workstation.
. Choose your library short code from the drop down menu.
+
image::images/intro/register-workstation-2.png[]
+
. Enter a unique workstation name.
+
[TIP]
=====
Your workstation settings and 
preferences are stored on Sitka's Evergreen server with your workstation name.

If you are re-registering a workstation you should use the original workstation's name or  
you will lose your stored workstation settings and preferences.
=====

+
image::images/intro/register-workstation-3.png[]

[NOTE]
======
Library administrators at multi-branch libraries may wish to register multiple workstations 
for certain computers/browsers.  See xref:_registered_workstations[] for information on
how this can be done.
======

Configuring Your Workstation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image::images/intro/colour-mode-1.png[]

Function Bar
^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Function Bar)))

The function bar can be found throughout Evergreen and enables you to page through pages,
adjust the number of rows displaying, access the Actions menu, and manage your columns and Actions menus.

The function bar comes in two styles with similar functionality.

image::images/intro/function-bar-1.png[]

Column Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Column Configuration)))

From many screens and lists, you can click on the column picker drop-down menu to change which columns
are displayed. Various search results tables may not default to the most useful columns. For instance,
the patron search results page may be easier to use if you change the columns to Card, Last Name,
First Name, Middle Name, and Primary Identification, and you may wish to have the results sort
by Last Name, then by First Name.

.To customize your columns:
. Click on the dropdown arrow or the settings symbol on the function bar to open the column picker.
.. Some options in the menu and the resulting screens will differ depending on the version of the function bar.
+
image::images/intro/column-configuration-1.png[]

. Click *Manage columns* for more options.

.. Click *Sort Visible Columns to Top*.
.. Click *Move Up* or *Move Down* to change column position.
.. Click *First Visible* or *Last Visible* to move the selected column to the top or bottom of the list.
.. Use *Sort Priority* to prioritize how sorting should work. (A negative number will sort the column in reverse order.)
... This option only appears in certain cases.
+
image::images/intro/column-configuration-2.png[]
+
. Click *Manage Column Widths*.
.. Click *Expand* or *Shrink* to adjust column sizes.
+

(((Actions Menu)))

Library Selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Library Selector)))

Some interfaces include a library selector that enables staff to set the scope for the interface.

There are currently several styles of the library selector.

The library selector in newer interfaces shows the full names of the library if 
xref:_include_full_library_names_in_library_selector[full names are enabled].

Where applicable *Ancestor* and *Descendants* checkboxes are included.  Multi-branch libraries can set
the library to their system and then check the *Descendants* checkbox to include all of their branches.

image::images/intro/library-selector-1.png[]

The library selector in older interfaces only shows the library shortcode.  This older style
of library selector will be phased out as future updates to Evergreen replace the older interfaces.

image::images/intro/library-selector-2.png[]


Filters
^^^^^^^
(((Filters)))

Some interfaces include filters that enable staff to filter the available rows.

image::images/intro/filters-1.png[]

Depending on the data in the field the filters will either allow you to filter on true/false or the text values.

image::images/intro/filters-2.png[]


image::images/intro/filters-3.png[]

When a column is filtered it will display with a blue Filter that can be edited to change the value of the filter.
Filters can be removed individually per column by clearing the filter or all filters can be removed at once
using the *Remove Filters* button.

image::images/intro/filters-4.png[]

Workstation Administration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[[getting-started-workstation-administration]]

Workstation specific information can be set by going to *Administration -> Workstation*.

Here staff can:

* xref:_registered_workstations[register additional workstations]
* xref:_printer_settings[configure printer settings]
* xref:_print_templates[customize receipt printer templates]
* xref:_stored_preferences[view and remove stored preferences]
* xref:_print_service_hatch[view information about Hatch]
* xref:_tests[run latency tests]
* xref:_disable_sounds[disable and test sounds for the staff client]
* xref:_library_selector_shows_combined_names[set the library selector to include the full name of libraries]

Staff should not use the search preferences settings found in Workstation Administration.  Instead
search preferences should be set from within the staff catalogue.  See xref:_search_preferences[].

(((Keyboard Navigation)))

Staff can use the following navigation bar functions to navigate Evergreen.
