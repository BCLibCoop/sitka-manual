Configuring Your Workstation
----------------------------

Colour Mode Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Evergreen staff client can be used in light mode or dark mode.

By default Evergreen will use the colour mode setting from your operating system; however,
you can manually switch from _Auto_ to _Light_ or _Dark_ using the *Colour Mode* menu.

Function Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Function Bar)))

The function bar can be found throughout Evergreen and enables you to page through pages,
adjust the number of rows displaying, access the Actions menu, and manage your columns and Actions menus.

The function bar currently comes in two styles with similar functionality.  Eventually all
interfaces in the staff client will use the second function bar pictured below.

Library Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Library Selector)))

Some interfaces include a library selector that enables staff to set the scope for the interface.

There are currently several styles of the library selector.

The library selector in newer interfaces shows the full names of the library if 
xref:_include_full_library_names_in_library_selector[full names are enabled].

Where applicable *Ancestor* and *Descendants* checkboxes are included.  Multi-branch libraries can set
the library to their system and then check the *Descendants* checkbox to include all of their branches.

image::images/intro/library-selector-1.png[]

The library selector in older interfaces only shows the library shortcode.  This older style
of library selector will be phased out as future updates to Evergreen replace the older interfaces.

Filters
~~~~~~~
(((Filters)))

Some interfaces include filters that enable staff to filter the available rows.

image::images/intro/filters-1.png[]

Depending on the data in the field the filters will either allow you to filter on true/false or the text values.

image::images/intro/filters-2.png[]


image::images/intro/filters-3.png[]

When a column is filtered it will display with a blue Filter that can be edited to change the value of the filter.
Filters can be removed individually per column by clearing the filter or all filters can be removed at once
using the *Remove Filters* button.

Workstation Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[getting-started-workstation-administration]]

Workstation specific information can be set by going to *Administration -> Workstation*.

Here staff can:

* xref:_registered_workstations[register additional workstations]
* xref:_printer_settings[configure printer settings]
* xref:_print_templates[customize receipt printer templates]
* xref:_stored_preferences[view and remove stored preferences]
* xref:_print_service_hatch[view information about Hatch]
* xref:_tests[run latency tests]
* xref:_disable_sounds[disable and test sounds for the staff client]
* xref:_library_selector_shows_combined_names[set the library selector to include the full name of libraries]

Staff should not use the search preferences settings found in Workstation Administration.  Instead
search preferences should be set from within the staff catalogue.  See xref:_search_preferences[].
