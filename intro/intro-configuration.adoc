Configuring Your Workstation
----------------------------

Colour Mode Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Evergreen staff client can be used in light mode or dark mode.

By default Evergreen will use the colour mode setting from your operating system; however,
you can manually switch from _Auto_ to _Light_ or _Dark_ using the *Colour Mode* menu.

Function Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Function Bar)))

The function bar can be found throughout Evergreen and enables you to page through pages,
adjust the number of rows displaying, access the Actions menu, and manage your columns and Actions menus.

The function bar currently comes in two styles with similar functionality.  Eventually all
interfaces in the staff client will use the second function bar pictured below.

. Actions Menu
. Adjust number of rows
. Jump to page
. Show Grid Options menu

Grid Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Grid Options* menu can be accessed from the xref:_function_bar[Function Bar] by clicking 
on the gear symbol.

image::images/intro/grid-options-1.png[]

Some options in the menu and the resulting screens will differ depending on the 
version of the xref:_function_bar[function bar].

[TIP]
=====
When saved, grid options are saved for the particular workstation. If you need
to xref:_registering_a_staff_workstation[re-register your workstation] you should use 
the original workstation's name or you will need to re-set all your grid settings across
 the staff client.

Columns
^^^^^^^
(((Column Configuration)))

Display Columns
+++++++++++++++

Library staff can customize what columns display and how they display in the grid 
for interfaces in the staff client using the *Manage Columns* option in the _Grid Options_. 

Available configuration options are:

* *Visible*: Whether a column is visible or hidden.
* *Align*: Whether the contents of the column aligns left, center, or right.  By default, text
aligns left and numbers align right.
* *Width (Characters)*: What the width of a column is.
* *Sort Priority*: What order the data is sorted by default when displayed in the grid.
* *Move*: What order the columns display in.  Columns can also be manually dragged and dropped
 when viewing the grid.

Column Width
++++++++++++

The width of columns can be adjusted for the grids.  The method to do so depends on the 
version of the function bar.

In newer interfaces you can use your cursor to drag the edges of the columns to expand or
shrink them. You can also set a width, measured in characters, by selecting *Manage Columns*
from the *Grid Options* menu. You can then enter a value in the _Width (Characters)_ field
for the applicable column.

image::images/intro/grid-column-width-1.png[]

In older interfaces you can select *Manage Column Widths* from the *Grid Options* menu and
then click *Expand* or *Shrink* to adjust the column sizes.

Save Grid Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes made to a grid through the grid options are temporary and the display of the 
grid will revert to its previous settings the next time it's viewed unless the grid 
settings are saved.

. Click on the *Show Grid Options (gear icon)* menu.
. Click *Save Grid Settings*.

Downloading and Printing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to print the information in the grid and one way to download it.  In all
cases the list will only include the items currently displaying on the screen.

Print Full Grid
+++++++++++++++

The *Print Full Grid* option available on the *Grid Options* menu (Gear Icon) will open a print dialogue and 
allow you to print the list which will include all the columns currently visible on the screen.

Print Selected Rows
+++++++++++++++++++

The *Print Selected Rows* option available on the *Grid Options* menu (Gear Icon) will open a print dialogue and 
allow you to print the selected rows as a list which will include all the columns currently visible 
on the screen.

Download Full CSV
+++++++++++++++++

The *Download Full CSV* option available on the *Grid Options* menu (Gear Icon) will download a CSV file 
which will include all the columns currently visible on the screen. 

image:images/circ/download-hold-pull-list-1.png[scaledwidth="75%"]


Library Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Library Selector)))

Some interfaces include a library selector that enables staff to set the scope for the interface.

There are currently several styles of the library selector.  

The library selector in newer interfaces shows the full names of the library if 
xref:_include_full_library_names_in_library_selector[full names are enabled].

Where applicable *Ancestor* and *Descendants* checkboxes are included.  Multi-branch libraries can set
the library to their system and then check the *Descendants* checkbox to include all of their branches.

image::images/intro/library-selector-1.png[]

The library selector in older interfaces only shows the library shortcode.  This older style
of library selector will be phased out as future updates to Evergreen replace the older interfaces.

Filters
~~~~~~~
(((Filters)))

Some interfaces include filters that enable staff to filter the available rows in the grid.

image::images/intro/filters-1.png[]

Depending on the data in the field the filters will either allow you to filter on Any/Yes/No
 or the text values.

image::images/intro/filters-2.png[]


image::images/intro/filters-3.png[]

When a column is filtered it will display with a pencil icon. Clicking on that icon 
enables you to change the value of the filter. Filters can be removed individually per 
column by clearing the filter or all filters can be removed at once using the 
*Remove Filters* button.

image::images/intro/filters-4.png[]

[NOTE]
======

Some interfaces, such as the xref:_shelving_location_editor[Shelving Location Editor],
have default filters applied.  The Shelving Location Editor has the filter for 
_Is Deleted_ set to _No_ so that deleted shelving locations do not display by default.

Workstation Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[getting-started-workstation-administration]]

Workstation specific information can be set by going to *Administration -> Workstation*.

Here staff can:

* xref:_registered_workstations[register additional workstations]
* xref:_printer_settings[configure printer settings]
* xref:_print_templates[customize receipt printer templates]
* xref:_stored_preferences[view and remove stored preferences]
* xref:_print_service_hatch[view information about Hatch]
* xref:_tests[run latency tests]
* xref:_disable_sounds[disable and test sounds for the staff client]
* xref:_library_selector_shows_combined_names[set the library selector to include the full name of libraries]

Staff should not use the search preferences settings found in Workstation Administration.  Instead
search preferences should be set from within the staff catalogue.  See xref:_search_preferences[].
