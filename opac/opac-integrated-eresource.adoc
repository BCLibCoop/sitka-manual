Integrated eResources
----------------------

Electronic resources are usually hosted by separate suppliers outside the library. Most of these resources 
have records in the library catalogue. Links leading to the suppliers' website are provided in these 
records. Some electronic resources can be integrated into the library catalogue, which allows users not 
only to view the records, but also to borrow and place holds on the resources on the library catalogue 
directly. Currently eBooks and eAudiobooks from OverDrive are integrated. Users can borrow or place 
holds on these eResources, and view their borrowed or on-hold items in their library account.

When your search result includes an integrated e-book or e-audiobook from OverDrive, you may see the record 
is marked as electronic resource with a link going to the supplier's website.You will see two columns 
for _Available Formats_ and _Status_. You may also see *Place Hold on E-book/E-audiobook*, or 
*Check Out E-book/E-audiobook*, depending on whether there is an available copy, instead of the normal
*Place Hold* option on the right hand side of the results list.
