Integrated E-Items
------------------

Electronic resources are usually hosted by separate providers outside the library. Most of these resources
have records in the library catalogue. Links leading to the provider's website are provided in these
records. Some electronic resources can be integrated into the library catalogue, which allows users not
only to view the records, but also to borrow and place holds on the resources on the library catalogue
directly. Currently eBooks and eAudiobooks from OverDrive are integrated. Users can borrow or place
holds on these eResources, and view their borrowed or on-hold items in their library account.

When your search result includes an integrated eBooks and eAudiobooks from OverDrive, you may see the record
is marked as electronic resource with a link going to the provider's website. You will see columns
for _Available Formats_ and _Status_. There will also be a button to *Check Out E-Item* or 
*Place Hold on E-Item*, depending on whether there is an available copy.

OverDrive allows users to keep some preference settings, such as preferred loan period. These 
preferences can be set up or updated through OverDrive's website or app.
