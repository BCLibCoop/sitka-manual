Search the Public Catalogue
---------------------------

The public catalogue can be accessed online from any location via the Internet.

(((Public Catalogue)))
(((OPAC)))

The generic public catalogue which searches all of Sitka is https://catalogue.libraries.coop. This catalogue
is also used in the staff client for searching the catalogue.

Each library has a public catalogue using their logo and colours.  The default URL for all library specific
public catalogues is https://LIBRARYCODE.PROVINCECODE.catalogue.libraries.coop.


Basic Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The public catalogue defaults to the Basic Search where you can search for books and other items at your library or
other libraries in the consortium.

Basic Search contains a single search box for you to enter a search term.

+
* Journal Title — finds the terms you enter in the title of a serial bibliographic record.
+
* Author — finds the terms you enter in the author of an item.

Formats
^^^^^^^

You can limit your search by format. Some of the more popular formats in the list are the following:

* For Books, you can choose _All Books_, which includes regular print books, large print books, and e-books, _All Audiobooks_, which includes audiobooks on physical media and e-audiobooks, OR you can choose the individual format.

[TIP]
=====
The format filter uses values from the Leader, 007, and 008 fields of the MARC record to determine which
records to include in your search results.  LINK TO CHAPTER 20
=====

Library
^^^^^^^

The current search library is displayed in the _Library_ box.

The default search library is your library or borrowing zone. If your library system has multiple branches
or a borrowing zone that includes multiple libraries you can use the _Library_ box to select different
branches or libraries.

If your library has multiple branches, your search result will display items available at your branch and
all branches of your library system separately. If your library participates in Interlibrary Connect
the results may display items available across the larger borrowing zone.

If you access the catalogue from https://catalogue.libraries.coop you may scope your search result to Sitka,
regional libraries, a library system or a library branch by clicking into the Library box on the catalogue
homepage and selecting the target library from the drop down list. You will then be able to see how many
copies of a title are available in all Sitka member libraries across Sitka, or within the regional libraries,
or within the library system, or within the branch, depending on search scope selected.

Advanced Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access the Advanced Search by clicking *Advanced Search* on the catalogue homepage or search
results screen.

The available search options are the same as in Basic Search, but you may use one or more of them
simultaneously. If you want to combine more than three search options, use the *Add Search Row* button to
add more search input rows. Clicking the *X* button will close the search input row.

Search Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current search library is displayed in the _Search Library_ box.

The default search library is your library or borrowing zone. If your library system has multiple branches
or a borrowing zone that includes multiple libraries you can use the _Search Library_ box to select different
branches or libraries.

If your library has multiple branches, your search result will display items available at your branch and
all branches of your library system separately. If your library participates in Interlibrary Connect
the results may display items available across the larger borrowing zone.

If you access the catalogue from https://catalogue.libraries.coop, your default search library is
Sitka or the library you have selected on the homepage. You may use the _Search Library_ box to select a
different library or regional libraries, or all libraries in Sitka to search.

Sort Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the search results are in order of greatest to least relevance. See OPAC Order of Results. In
the _Sort Results_ box you may select to order the search results by relevance, title, author,
publication date, or popularity.

Limit to Available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the _Limit to Available_ checkbox is checked search results are limited based on an item’s current
circulation status. Titles without available items in the selected search library will not be displayed.

Item statuses that show as available are: _Available_, _On Display_, _Onsite Consultation_, _Reserves_,
and _Reshelving_.

Group Formats and Editions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the _Group Formats and Editions_ checkbox is checked all formats and editions of the same title are
grouped as one result. For example, the DVD and the first and second print editions of _Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets_ will appear together.

Exclude Electronic Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the _Exclude Electronic Resources_ checkbox is checked electronic resources are not included
 in the search results.

Search Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can filter your search by:

* Format
+
* Language
+
* Audience
+
* Literary Form
+
* Publication Year
+
** Publication year is inclusive. For example, if you set Publication Year Between 2005 and 2007,
your result items will be published in 2005, 2006 and 2007.
+
* Shelving Location
+
** Shelving Locations that are not OPAC visible will not be displayed

[TIP]
=====
All the search filters, with the exception of Shelving Location, rely on values entered into the Leader,
007, or 008 fields of the MARC record.  Records with incorrect coding will not filter correctly.

Search Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~

You do not need to enter an author's last name first, nor do you need an exact title or subject heading as
all searches are keyword search. Evergreen is also forgiving about plurals and alternate verb endings, so
if you enter _dogs_, Evergreen will also find items with _dog_.

* Do not use an AND operator to join search terms.

  - An AND operator is automatically used to join all search terms. So, a search for _golden compass_ will
  search for entries that contain both _golden_ and _compass_.

  - Boolean operators such as _and_, _or_, _not_ are not considered special and are searched for like any
  other word. So, a title search for _golden and compass_ will not return the title _golden compass_. Putting
  it another way, there are no stop words that are automatically ignored by the search engine. So, a title
  search for _the_, _and_, _or_,  _not_  (in any order) yields a list of titles with those words.

* Don’t worry about white space, exact punctuation, or capitalization.

  - White spaces before or after a word are ignored. So, search for _golden compass_ gives the same results
  as a search for _golden compass_.

  - A double dash or a colon between words is reduced to a blank space. So, a title search for
  _golden:compass_ or _golden--compass_ is equivalent to _golden compass_.

  - Punctuation marks occurring at the front or end of a word are removed.

  - Diacritical marks, &, or | located anywhere in the search term but not within a word are removed. Words
  linked together by . (dot) are separated into two words. So, a search for _|golden.compass&_ is equivalent
  to _golden compass_.

  - Upper and lower case letters are equivalent. So, _Golden Compass_ is the same as _golden compass_.

* Enter your search words in any order. A search for _compass golden_ gives the same results as a search
for _golden compass_. Adding more search words gives fewer and more specific results.

  - This is also true for author searches. Both _David Suzuki_ and _Suzuki, David_ will return results for
  the same author.
+
* Use specific search terms. Evergreen will search for the words you specify, not the meanings, so choose
search terms that are likely to appear in an item description. For example, the search _luxury hotels_ will
produce more relevant results than _nice places to stay_.

* Search for an exact phrase using double-quotes. For example, “golden compass”.

  - The order of words is important for an exact phrase search. _“golden compass”_ is different than
  _“compass golden”_.

  - White space, punctuation and capitalization are removed from exact phrases as described above. So a
  phrase retains its search terms and its relative order, but not special characters, such as a + (plus),
  and not case.

  - Two phrases are joined by AND, so a search for _“golden compass”_ _“dark materials”_ is equivalent to
  _“golden compass”_ and _“dark materials”_.

  - To prevent xref:XXXXXXX [stemming], use double quotes around a single word or a phrase. So, a search
  for _parenting_ will also return results for _parental_ but a search for _“parenting”_ will not.

* Use * (asterisk) as a wildcard to truncate search terms, e.g. _comp* golden_ may return the same results
for _compass golden_ and more.

* Exclude a term from the search, using - (minus) . For example, _vacations –britain_ will search for
materials on vacations that do not make reference to Britain.

  - Two excluded words are joined by _AND_. So, a search for _-harry -potter_ is equivalent to
  _-harry_ and _-potter_.

  - A + (plus) leading a term has no role and is removed. So, _+golden +compass_ is equivalent to
  _golden compass_.

You can form more complex searches using the Advanced Search features.

Improving a Search With No Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If no results were returned from your search, you will see Keyword Search Tips for expanding or altering
your search.


Search Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stemming
^^^^^^^^

A search for _dogs_ will also return results with the word _dog_ and a search for _parenting_ will return
results with the words _parent_ and _parental_. This is because the search uses stemming to help return the
most relevant results. That is, words are reduced to their stem (or root word) before the search is performed.

The stemming algorithm relies on common English language patterns - like verbs ending in ing - to find the
stems. This is more efficient that looking up each search term in a dictionary and usually produces desirable
results. However, it also means the search will sometimes reduce a word to an incorrect stem and cause
unexpected results. To prevent a word or phrase from stemming, put it in double-quotes.

Understanding how stemming works can help you to create more relevant searches, but it is usually best not
to anticipate how a search term will be stemmed. For example, searching for gold compass does not return
for _golden compass_ because the search does not recognize _gold_ as a stem of _golden_.

Truncation
^^^^^^^^^^

Use the wildcard * (asterisk) at the end of the word to truncate search term.

Order of Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the results in the Sitka catalogue are listed in order of relevance, similar to a search engine
like Google. The relevance is determined using a number of factors, including how often and where the search
terms appear in the item description, and whether the search terms are part of the title, subject, author,
or series. The results that best match your search are returned first rather than results appearing in
alphabetical or chronological order.

In the Advanced Search screen, you may select to order the search results by relevance, title, author,
publication date or popularity before you start the search. You can also re-order your search results
using the _Sort by_ dropdown list on the search result screen.

Popularity
^^^^^^^^^^

The popularity sort options can use factors such as circulation and hold activity, record and item age, and
item ownership counts to generate popularity badges for bibliographic records. Each badge has a five-point
scale, where more points indicates a more popular record. The average of the badge points earned by each
record constitutes a "popularity rating". The number and types of badges break ties for average popularity,
and relevance sorts items with like popularity.

image::images/opac/opac-popularity-1.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Basic Search"]


NOTE: Currently popularity badges have been set up in Sitka based on hold and circulation counts over the
last 3 years.




Search Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The search results are a list of relevant works from the catalogue. If there are many results, they are
divided into several pages. At the top of the list, you can see the total number of results and go back and
forth between the pages by clicking the double arrow on top or bottom of the list or click the page number
to go to that page directly.

Your search terms will be highlighted both the search results and title details screens.

image::images/opac/opac-search-results-1.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Basic Search"]

Information about the title, such as author, edition, publication date, call number, shelving location,
status, etc., is displayed under each title. The icons below the title link indicate formats such as books,
audiobooks, video recordings, and other formats. Hover your mouse over the icon, and a text explanation
will show up in a small pop-up box.

Clicking a title goes to the title details. Clicking an author searches all works by the author. If you
want to place a hold on the title, click *Place Hold* to the right of the title information.

Above the results list there are _Limit to Available_ and _Exclude Electronic Resources_ checkboxes. Checking
_Limit to Available_ will filter out those titles with no available copies in the library or libraries at
the moment.  Checking _Exclude Electronic Resources_ will filter out titles for electronic resources. Usually
you will see your search results re-displayed with fewer results.

The _Sort by_ dropdown list is beside the checkboxes. Clicking an entry on the list will
re-sort your search results accordingly.

Formats and Editions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have selected _Group Formats and Editions_ with your search, your search results are grouped by
various formats and editions of the same title. Multiple format icons may be lit up.

image::images/opac/opac-search-results-2.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Basic Search"]


Refine Your Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may refine your search results by _Topic_, _Place_, and _Genre_. Selecting one of these links on the left
side of search results page narrows down the search results to that subject, author, or series. You may
also refine your search by clicking the hyperlink labelled *Refine My Original Search* at top of search
results. Refining a search this way allows you to add search filters such as Publication Date, Format,
Language, etc., to your original search.

image::images/opac/opac-search-results-3.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Basic Search"]


Expand Your Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may expand your search results by removing search limiters that you applied in your initial search.
You can remove a limiter by clicking on the _X_ beside it.

image::images/opac/opac-search-results-4.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Basic Search"]


Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of available copies and total copies are displayed below the title details.

The availability will be scoped depending on your search library. If your library is a multi-branch
system you can see how many copies are available in all branches. If your library participates in a
larger borrowing zone you will see the available copies at your search library and the larger zone.

image::images/opac/opac-search-results-5.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Basic Search"]

If you are searching multiple branches or libraries you will see the libraries with copies listed.


Viewing a record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click on a title to view a detailed record of the title, including descriptive information, location
and availability, and options for placing holds.


Details
^^^^^^^

The record shows details such as the cover image, title, author, publication information, and an abstract or
summary, if available.

The Record Details view shows how many copies are at the library or libraries you have selected, and whether
they are available or checked out. It also displays the _Call number_ and _Copy Location_ for locating the
item on the shelves. Clicking on *Text* beside the call number will allow you to send the item's call number
by text message, if desired. Clicking the location library link will reveal information about owning library,
such as address and open hours.

Below the local details you can open up various tabs to display more information. You can select
_Reviews and More_ to see the book’s summaries and reviews, if available. You can select
_Shelf Browser_ to view items appearing near the current item on the library shelves. Often this is a good way
to browse for similar items. You can select _MARC Record_ to display the record in MARC format. If your
library offers the service, clicking on _Awards, Reviews, and Suggested Reads_ will reveal that additional
information.

Search Additional Items by Author, Subject or Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can search for additional items by an author, one of the subjects in the record or other works in the same
series. Clicking the author, subject or series will start a new search in the catalogue. You can do this from
the results page or from within the record details view.


Going back
^^^^^^^^^^

When you are viewing a specific record, you can always go back to your title list by clicking the link
*Search Results* on the left of the page.


If you have selected _Group Formats and Editions_ with your search, your search results are grouped by various
formats and editions of the same title under _My Search Results_. You can always go back to this page by
selecting the link to *Return to Grouped Search Results*.


You can start a new search at any time by entering new search terms in the search box at the top of the page,
 or by selecting the *Another Search*, *Basic Search*,or *Advanced Search* link at top of search results,
 depending on what screen you are on when wanting to do another search
