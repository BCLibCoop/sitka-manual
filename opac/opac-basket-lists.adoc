Baskets and Lists

(((Baskets and Lists)))
(((Print and Email, Baskets and Lists)))
(((Print and Email, OPAC)))
(((Print and Email, Public Catalogue)))

The basket feature in your public catalogue enables patrons to add titles in batch to a temporary basket.  From the basket, you
can place holds, print and email title details, and add the titles to a new or existing list.

Lists are maintained in My Account and you must be logged in to use this feature. Lists can be used to keep
track of what books have been read, to maintain a class reading list, to maintain a
reading list for a book club, and more. Lists can also be used for maintaining publicly visible lists such as
staff picks or themed lists that can be posted on a library's website.  

Lists are accessed via the _My Lists_ section of  _My Account_.

Adding Titles to the Basket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Titles can be added to the basket in three ways:

* by checking the box beside the search result.  The entire page of results can be added by checking
 the select all box at the top of the results.

the count beside the basket icon.

batch place holds, print or email the title details for all titles, add the contents of the basket to a
saved list, and clear the basket.

[NOTE]
======
Libraries can use shared lists for sharing staff picks and other lists with patrons by creating a list 
and posting the URL on the library's website.

Co-op Support recommends libraries set up a patron account specifically to use for this instead of having
staff use their own acounts.
