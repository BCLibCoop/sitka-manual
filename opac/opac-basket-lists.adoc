Baskets and Lists
----------------

(((Baskets and Lists)))

The basket feature enables patrons to add titles in batch to a temporary basket.  From the basket patrons
can place holds, print and email title details, and add the titles to a new or existing list.

Lists are lists of items that can be used for a number of purposes. For example, patrons use lists to keep
track of what books they've read, books they'd like to read, to maintain a class reading list, to maintain a
reading list for a book club, and more. Lists can also be used for maintaining publicly visible lists such as
staff picks or themed lists that can be posted on a library's website.  Lists are also used with Course
Reserves module for post-secondary institutions.

Lists are accessed via the  _My Lists_ section of  _My Account_.
