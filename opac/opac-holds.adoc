Public Catalogue Holds
----------------------

(((Holds, Public Catalogue)))

Holds can be placed for a particular title or a specific volume through your public catalogue. 

Available items will appear on the library's holds pull list. If the item is not available, 
the patron is placed on a waiting list and notified when the item become available.

[NOTE]
======
Some libraries do not allow holds to be placed on available items.

Unsuccessful Hold Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a hold cannot be placed Evergreen will return the message "Hold was not successfully placed".  This will
be accompanied by a reason why the hold cannot be placed and in some cases the option to override.

*Problem: The patron has reached the maxiumum number of holds* - This indicates the patron has reached
the maximum number of items they can have on hold at a time based on the library's hold policies.

*Problem: All available copies are temporarily unavailable at your pickup library.  Placing this hold
could result in longer wait times.* - This indicates that the item is under age-based hold protection 
set through the Holdings Editor and cannot currently fill holds at your library.  If you override and 
place the hold it will eventually be filled when the item is no longer protected.

*Problem: Holds are not allowed on this item by library's policy* - This indicates that the item is under 
age-based hold protection set through the Hold Policies and cannot currently fill holds at your library.  It can
also indicate that the library has blocked holds placed by a particular patron type or on items using a particular 
circulation modifier through their hold policies.
