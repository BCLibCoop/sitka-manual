Public Catalogue Holds
----------------------

(((Holds, Public Catalogue)))

You and your patrons can place holds for a particular title or a specific volume on your public catalogue. If the item is available, it will appear on a library's holds pull list and be pulled from the shelf and held for your patron. If the item is not available, the patron is placed on a waiting list and notified when the item become available.

NOTE: Some libraries do not allow holds to be placed on available items.

Title and Volume Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Best practice is to place holds using the *Place Hold* link in the search results view or on the title details page.
Using either of these links means that any copy attached to the record will fill the hold. This is generally
the best method when requesting an item, as the hold will be filled by any copy of the title record you are
viewing.

If you want a specific issue of a magazine or a specific DVD in a set,  select *Volume Hold*
in the item details grid.

You will be prompted to log in with your library account, if you have not already done so.

If your library is multi-branch, or participates in resource sharing, you can choose the
pickup location.

You can choose to be notified by phone, text message, or email. The notification method will be selected
automatically if it is set in account preferences, but can be overridden on this screen.

The phone number and email in your account will be used to populate the notification options, but
you can use a different phone number for phone or text notification when placing the hold.

You can suspend the hold to be activated at a later date.

Once you click *Submit* a message will appear confirming the hold was successfully placed or
indicating that the hold could not be placed.

You can view and cancel your holds at anytime through My Account, and can edit, suspend, or activate
your holds until they are captured for pick up.


Placing Holds on Multiple Records of the Same Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If _Group by Formats and Edition_ was selected when doing a search, you can place a hold on multiple
records  of the title, but of different formats or editions, by clicking *Place Hold* to the right of the
meta record.

Unsuccessful Hold Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a hold cannot be placed Evergreen will return the message "Hold was not successfully placed".  This will
be accompanied by a reason why the hold cannot be placed and in some cases the option to override.

*Problem: The patron has reached the maxiumum number of holds* - This indicates the patron has reached
the maximum number of items they can have on hold at a time based on the library's hold policies.

*Problem: All available copies are temporarily unavailable at your pickup library.  Placing this hold
could result in longer wait times.* - This indicates that the item is under age-based hold protection 
set through the Holdings Editor and cannot currently fill holds at your library.  If you override and 
place the hold it will eventually be filled when the item is no longer protected.

*Problem: Holds are not allowed on this item by library's policy* - This indicates that the item is under 
age-based hold protection set through the Hold Policies and cannot currently fill holds at your library.  It can
also indicate that the library has blocked holds placed by a particular patron type or on items using a particular 
circulation modifier through their hold policies.
