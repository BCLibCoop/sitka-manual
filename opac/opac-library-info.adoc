Library Information
-------------------

Evergreen generates a page in the public catalogue which pulls together information about your library
and branches for your patrons. What information displays depends on whether or not
you have entered the applicable information into Evergreen.

The page is accessed by clicking on the library or branch name in the _Location_ column of your search
results.

Multi-branch libraries will have pages for their system and each branch.

https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] can also add it as a link on your public catalogue.

If you would like a link to your library's website on the library information page you can add
it using the library setting _Library information URL (such as "http://example.com/about.html")_.
