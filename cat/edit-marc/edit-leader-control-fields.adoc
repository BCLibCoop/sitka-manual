Editing the Leader and Control Fields 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Leader and control fields (006, 007, and 008) can be edited directly via the 
Flat Text Editor.  Cataloguers need to ensure that they count the characters and add values
in the correct position in the fields.

The Leader and control fields (006, 007, and 008) can be edited via the Enhanced MARC Editor.
The Enhanced MARC Editor Grid includes boxes to enter values for characters of the Leader
and 008 field.  The Enhanced MARC Editor also includes the Physical Characteristics Wizard
which is used to create a 007 field.

Information about the characters of tLeader and the 008 can be found on the Library of Congress's MARC Standards 
page at https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/


[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon specifications 
in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].

Enhanced MARC Editor Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Retrieve and display the record in MARC Edit.
. Click into any box displayed in the fixed field editor. In this example we are editing the first position, 
the Type or Format box, to describe the format of the resource, textual material, by use of an "a".
.. Some fields have spaces as values so you need to backspace your cursor to the very beginning 
of the box in order to type in a new value.  
+

. For some fields, right-clicking in the box will show a list of possible values (eg. BLvl, Type, Form Audn, and Lang). 
Choose from this list to populate the box.
+

+
. You can press the *Tab* key or use the mouse to click through to each field, and can delete and add 
text as required by backspacing or highlighting existing text and over typing. Here the publication 
date is being edited; catalogue searches filtered by date rely on correct coding in the 008.

Physical Characteristics Wizard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MARC Fixed Field 007 Physical Characteristics Wizard enables catalogers to interact with a 
database wizard that leads the user step-by-step through the MARC 007 field positions. 
The wizard displays the significance of the current position and provides drop down lists of 
possible values for the various components of the MARC 007 field in a more user-friendly way.

*To Access the Physical Characteristics Wizard for a Record that Does Not Already Contain the 007 Field 
(i.e. Creating the 007 Field from Scratch):*

. Within the bibliographic record that needs to be edited go to the *Enhanced MARC Editor*.

. Right-click in the MARC field column and click *Add 007*.
+
image::images/cat/pcw-1.png[]
+
. Click the blue icon to the right of the 007 field.
+
image::images/cat/pcw-2.png[]
+
. The *Physical Characteristics Wizard* will open.

*Using the Physical Characteristics Wizard:*

As the user navigates through the wizard, each position will display its corresponding label that describes 
the significance of that position. Each position contains a selection of drop down choices that list the 
possible values for that particular position. When the user makes a selection from the drop down options, 
the value for that position will also change.

The first value defines the *Category of Material*. The choices within the remaining character positions 
will be appropriate for the Category of Material selected.

. Select the Category of Material for the given record by choosing an option from the *Category of Material* 
drop down menu.

. Once the Category of Material is selected, click *Next*.

. Evergreen will display the result of each selection in the preview above. The character of your current 
position will be in red.
+

+
. By clicking either the *Previous* or *Next* buttons, the user may step forward and backward, as needed, 
through the various positions in the 007 field.

. Once the user enters all of the applicable values for the 007 field and is ready to exit the wizard, 
click *Apply*.
+

+
. All of the values selected will be stored and displayed within the 007 field of the bibliographic record.
