The MARC Fixed Field 007 Physical Characteristics Wizard enables catalogers to interact with a 
database wizard that leads the user step-by-step through the MARC 007 field positions. 
The wizard displays the significance of the current position and provides drop down lists of 
possible values for the various components of the MARC 007 field in a more user-friendly way.

*To Access the Physical Characteristics Wizard for a Record that Does Not Already Contain the 007 Field 
(i.e. Creating the 007 Field from Scratch):*

. Within the bibliographic record that needs to be edited go to the *Enhanced MARC Editor*.

. Right-click in the MARC field column and click *Add 007*.

. The *Physical Characteristics Wizard* will open.

*Using the Physical Characteristics Wizard:*

As the user navigates through the wizard, each position will display its corresponding label that describes 
the significance of that position. Each position contains a selection of drop down choices that list the 
possible values for that particular position. When the user makes a selection from the drop down options, 
the value for that position will also change.

The first value defines the *Category of Material*. The choices within the remaining character positions 
will be appropriate for the Category of Material selected.

. Select the Category of Material for the given record by choosing an option from the *Category of Material* 
drop down menu.

. Once the Category of Material is selected, click *Next*.

. Evergreen will display the result of each selection in the preview above. The character of your current 
position will be in red.

through the various positions in the 007 field.

click *Apply*.
