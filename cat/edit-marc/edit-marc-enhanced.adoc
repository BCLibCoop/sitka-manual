Enhanced MARC Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Enhanced MARC Editor is used when working with MARC records.  Information from the
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[MARC21 Format for Bibliographic Data] has been built
into the enhanced editor to assist cataloguers; however, cataloguers should refer to MARC21 
for more information as needed.

The Enhanced MARC Editor can be divided into five parts:

. xref:_leader_and_008_field_grid[Leader and 008 Field Grid]
. xref:_help_and_additional_options[Help and Additional Options]
. xref:_marc_record[MARC Record]
. xref:_physical_characteristics_wizard[Physical Characteristics Wizard] - only present when
the record includes an 007 field
. xref:_authorities_linker[Authorities Linker] - not currently used by Sitka

////
The Leader and control fields (006, 007, and 008) can be edited via the Enhanced MARC Editor.
The Enhanced MARC Editor Grid includes boxes to enter values for characters of the Leader
and 008 field.  The Enhanced MARC Editor also includes the Physical Characteristics Wizard
which is used to edit and create 007 fields.

Please refer to the https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[MARC21 Format for Bibliographic Data]
for information about the characters and values for the 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bdleader.html[Leader] and 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd00x.html[control fields]. 


Accessing the MARC Editor

Leader and 008 Field Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specific characters of the Leader and 008 field can be updated using the Leader and 008 
Field Grid.  This enables cataloguers to easily update specific values without having to count
out the field characters.

image::images/cat/marc/leader-008-field-grid-1.png[Screenshot showing the grid for a 
projected medium record]

* Values can be edited directly in the grid boxes.
* Right-clicking in most boxes will display a list of the possible values as per MARC21
* Changing the values of certain boxes, such as Type and BLvl, changes the type of
material that is being described. In some cases this means that the meaning of the characters
 of the 008 changes.  The grid will change to display the fields relevant to the material.
** There is currently a bug where the grid doesn't automatically update.  If you change
the value of the Type and/or BLvl fields you must save the MARC record and reload it in a 
new tab to see the updated grid.

[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon 
specifications for Sitka's Evergreen in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].

been saved yet.  The number of changes that can be undone or redone will display on the

Physical Characteristics Wizard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

link:https://youtu.be/h5o8c6z5U9I[*Sitka Snippet Video - Physical Characteristics Wizard (3:52)*]

Cataoguers can easily edit and create 007 fields using the Physical Characteristics Wizard.

[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon 
specifications for Sitka's Evergreen in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].
=====

As the cataloguer navigates through the wizard, each position will display its corresponding label that describes 
the significance of that position. Each position contains a selection of drop down choices that list the 
possible values for that particular position. When the cataloguer makes a selection from the drop down options, 
the value for that position will also change.
