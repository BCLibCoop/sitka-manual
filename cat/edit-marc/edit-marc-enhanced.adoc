Enhanced MARC Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Enhanced MARC Editor is used when working with MARC records.  Information from the
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data] has been built
into the enhanced editor to assist cataloguers; however, cataloguers should refer 
to https://www.loc.gov/marc/[MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data]/
https://www.marc21.ca/M21/BIB/B001-Sommaire.html[Normes MARC 21] 
for more information as needed.

The Enhanced MARC Editor can be divided into five parts:

. xref:_leader_and_008_field_grid[Leader and 008 Field Grid]
. xref:_help_and_additional_options[Help and Additional Options]
. xref:_marc_record[MARC Record]
. xref:_physical_characteristics_wizard[Physical Characteristics Wizard] - only present when
the record includes an 007 field
. xref:_authorities_linker[Authorities Linker] - not currently used by Sitka

Leader and 008 Field Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specific characters of the Leader and 008 field can be updated using the Leader and 008 
Field Grid.  This enables cataloguers to easily update specific values without having to count
out the field characters.

image::images/cat/marc/leader-008-field-grid-1.png[]

* Values can be edited directly in the grid boxes.
* Right-clicking in most boxes will display a list of the possible values as per MARC21.
* A table giving the names and character positions for the abbreviations used by Evergreen
can be found in xref:_character_codes_for_leader_and_008_field_grid[].
* Changing the values of certain boxes, such as Type and BLvl, changes the type of
material that is being described. In some cases this means that the meaning of the characters
 of the 008 changes.  The grid will change to display the fields relevant to the material.
** There is currently a bug where the grid doesn't automatically update.  If you change
the value of the Type and/or BLvl fields you must save the MARC record and reload it in a 
new tab to see the updated grid.

[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon 
specifications for Sitka's Evergreen in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].

Help and Additional Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

image::images/cat/marc/help-additional-options-1.png[]

* When the *Help* button is clicked, a list of keyboard shortcuts that can be used to edit
the MARC record display.
* The *Validate* button is a function of authorities which are not currently used in Sitka's 
Evergreen.
* The *Undo* and *Redo* buttons can be used to undo and redo changes that haven't 
been saved yet.  The number of changes that can be undone or redone will display on the
buttons.
* When the *Stack Subfields* checkbox is checked, the subfields in the MARC record display
stacked vertically on separate lines from the field numbers, instead of each field displaying
with all subfields horizontally.
 

MARC Record
^^^^^^^^^^^

Fields in the MARC Record can be edited by clicking into the boxes you wish to edit and
making your changes.  A number of options are available by right-clicking into boxes
which will aid cataloguers in entering correct MARC coding.

* Right-clicking in the MARC tag boxes will provide options for adding and 
removing fields.  This includes adding 006, 007, and 008 control fields.

* Right-clicking in the MARC tag boxes will list potential fields that can be added.  This
is a partial list; cataloguers should refer to 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/[MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data]/
https://www.marc21.ca/M21/BIB/B001-Sommaire.html[Normes MARC 21] for a comprehensive list.

Physical Characteristics Wizard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

link:https://youtu.be/h5o8c6z5U9I[*Sitka Snippet Video - Physical Characteristics Wizard (3:52)*]

Cataoguers can easily edit and create 007 fields using the Physical Characteristics Wizard.

[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon 
specifications for Sitka's Evergreen in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].
=====

As a cataloguer navigates through the wizard, each position will display its corresponding label that describes 
the significance of that position. Each position contains a selection of drop down choices that list the 
possible values for that particular position. When the cataloguer makes a selection from the drop down options, 
the value for that position will also change.  Cataloguers should refer to 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/[MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data]/
https://www.marc21.ca/M21/BIB/B001-Sommaire.html[Normes MARC 21] for more information as needed.

Authorities Linker

currently used in Sitka's Evergreen and so this button should not be used.
