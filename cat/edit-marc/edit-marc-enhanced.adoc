Enhanced MARC Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Enhanced MARC Editor is used when creating or editing MARC records.


The Leader and control fields (006, 007, and 008) can be edited via the Enhanced MARC Editor.
The Enhanced MARC Editor Grid includes boxes to enter values for characters of the Leader
and 008 field.  The Enhanced MARC Editor also includes the Physical Characteristics Wizard
which is used to edit and create 007 fields.

Please refer to the https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[MARC21 Format for Bibliographic Data]
for information about the characters and values for the 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bdleader.html[Leader] and 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd00x.html[control fields]. 


[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon 
specifications for Sitka's Evergreen in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].

of the box in order to type in a new value.  
+

Cataoguers can easily edit and create 007 fields using the Physical Characteristics Wizard.

As the user navigates through the wizard, each position will display its corresponding label that describes 
the significance of that position. Each position contains a selection of drop down choices that list the 
possible values for that particular position. When the user makes a selection from the drop down options, 
the value for that position will also change.

. Search the catalogue for the record you wish to edit, as described
in xref:_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes[].

. Click on the title link to open the record.
