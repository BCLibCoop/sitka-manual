Flat Text Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Flat Text Editor is used when creating or editing MARC records.


The Leader and control fields (006, 007, and 008) can also be edited directly via the 
xref:_flat_text_editor[Flat Text Editor].  When using the Flat Text Editor, cataloguers need 
to ensure that they count the characters in the fields and add the values in the correct 
positions.

Please refer to the https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[MARC21 Format for Bibliographic Data]
for information about the characters and values for the 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bdleader.html[Leader] and 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd00x.html[control fields]. 


[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon 
specifications for Sitka's Evergreen in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].

Flat Text Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The text of the MARC record can be edited directly in the Flat Text Editor.

* The fields, indicators, and values are in fixed positions in the Flat Text Editor.
* Each MARC field begins with a = followed by the 3 digit tag for the field.
* If there is no value for an indicator "\" is used to fill the space.
* The "\" is also used in the control fields (Leader, 006, 007, and 008) for characters where 
no value is specified.
