Flat Text Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Flat Text Editor is used when working with MARC records. 

[NOTE]
======
When working with MARC records cataloguers must follow Sitka's Cataloguing Policy for 
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_editing_bibliographic_records.html[editing MARC records].
======

[CAUTION]
=========
Cataloguers should be cautious when using the Flat Text Editor and always double check
any changes before saving.  It is very easy to make significant changes to multiple fields
while using the Flat Text Editor. 
=========


The text of the MARC record can be edited directly in the Flat Text Editor.

* An equals sign "=" indicates the start of a MARC field
* The leader and control fields contain the 3-digit MARC tag followed by the field values.
** A backslash "\" is used in the leader and control fields for characters where 
no value is specified.
** Cataloguers need to ensure that they count the characters in the fields and 
add the values in the correct positions.  
* All other MARC fields contain the 3-digit MARC tag, followed by the indicators, and then
the appropriate subfield
* If there is no value for an indicator a backslash "\" is used to fill the space.
* A dollar sign "$" is used for the subfield delimiter

[TIP]
=====
The search filters and format icons in the public catalogue rely on 
accurate coding in the Leader, 007 and 008 fields. Please see the format filter and icon 
specifications for Sitka's Evergreen in xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[].
