This lesson will demonstrate merging bibliographic records in the catalogue. A common application for this functionality is to replace brief records with full records to keep one bibliographic record for one title. 

Any volume and copy records or holds associated with the brief record will be transferred to the full record upon merging.

. Records are merged via *Record Bucket*. You need to have a bucket for the records you wish to merge. See xref:create-record-bucket[] for detailed instructions. In the examples below the bucket is named Horse Books.

. Identify records to be merged and add them to the bucket See xref:add-record-to-bucket[] for detailed instructions.
