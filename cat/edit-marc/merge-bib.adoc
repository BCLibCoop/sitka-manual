Merging Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://youtu.be/Why90G2qizg[*Sitka Training Video - Merging Duplicate Bibliographic Records (5:10)*]

Ideally each discrete bibliographic title in Evergreen should have a single record that all libraries
attach their holdings to.  Where this is not the case library staff with the cataloguing knowledge to 
correctly identify matching MARC records can merge those records together.

Any call number and item records, or holds, associated with the non-lead records will be transferred to 
the lead record upon merging.

. Add the desired records to a record bucket.  See xref:_adding_records_to_a_record_bucket[].
+
[NOTE]
======
When creating your bucket Co-op Support recommends using the title of the records you are merging.
======
. Retrieve the bucket by selecting *Cataloguing -> Record Buckets* on the menu bar.
+
. Click the drop down arrow beside *Buckets*, then select the bucket containing the records to be merged.

. The merge screen opens in a pop-up window. 
.. The record summary is listed above. You may shorten it by 
clicking the double arrows. 
.. Clicking *Toggle Holdings Display* will display the holdings information below each MARC record.

. If after comparing the MARC records you determine that any of them are not a match for merging click 
*Remove from consideration*. The record will no longer be included in the merge.

. Leave the merge profile as "Keep Local Fields".  Any 050, 055, 092, 590, 595, 690, 852, and 856 fields 
from non-lead records will be moved to the lead record.
+

. From the remaining records determine which is the best record and click *Use as lead record*.

. Edit buttons will appear for the lead record. You can edit the record if edits are necessary.  Any edits need to 
follow Sitka http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Cataloguing Policy].

. Click *Merge*. The lead record will open in the catalogue in a new tab. 


[NOTE]
=====
While you can edit call numbers and/or items from the merge screen, Co-op Support recommends you focus 
on bibliographic records here. After the merging is done, you can edit your call numbers and items through the
xref:_holdings_editor[Holdings Editor].
=====


[CAUTION]
=========
Deleted records will remain in a record Bucket. We recommend you merge records right after you add 
them to the bucket. If you merge them later, good practice is to check the *Deleted* column in the bucket  
before merging to avoid merging records into a deleted record.
