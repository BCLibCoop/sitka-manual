Merging Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://goo.gl/91kp4e[Sitka Training Video - Merge Duplicate Bibliographic Records (7:31)]

This lesson will demonstrate merging bibliographic records in the catalogue. A common application for this functionality is to replace brief records with full records to keep one bibliographic record for one title.

Any volume and copy records, or holds, associated with the brief record, will be transferred to the full record upon merging.

. Records are merged via a *Record Bucket*. You need to have a bucket for the records you wish to merge. To create a record bucket, refer to  xref:create-record-bucket[] for detailed instructions. In the example below the bucket is named "merge117036601".

. Identify records to be merged and add them to the bucket. See xref:add-record-to-bucket[] for detailed instructions.

. Retrieve the bucket by selecting *Cataloguing -> Record Buckets* on menu bar.

. Click the drop down arrow beside *Buckets*, then select the bucket containing the records to be merged.

. Merge screen opens in a pop-up window. Record summary is listed above. You may shorten it by clicking the double arrows. You may also *Toggle Holdings Display*, which is positioned at the bottom of the screen.  You can remove a record if you decide not to merge it by clicking *Remove from consideration*. Once decided on a lead record, click *Use as lead record*.

. Once ready, click *Merge*. The lead record is displayed in the catalogue.



[NOTE]
=====
While you can edit volumes and/or copies from merge screen, Co-op Support recommends you focus on bibliographic records on merge screen. After the merging is done, you can edit your volume/copy on Holdings View.

[TIP]
=====
Merging time and target record is displayed when the merged non-lead records are retrieved.

[CAUTION]
=========
Deleted records remain in a Record Bucket. We suggest you merge records right after you add them to the bucket. If you merge them later, good practice is to check the records again before merging to avoid merging them into a deleted record. Right now, deleted records are not indicated on merge screen.
