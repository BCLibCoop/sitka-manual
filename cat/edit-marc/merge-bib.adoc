Merging Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://youtu.be/Why90G2qizg[*Sitka Training Video - Merging Duplicate Bibliographic Records (5:10)*]

This section will demonstrate merging bibliographic records in the catalogue. A common application for this functionality is to replace brief records with full records to keep one bibliographic record for one title.

Any call number and item records, or holds, associated with the non-lead records will be transferred to 
the lead record upon merging.

. Through a catalogue search identify records to be merged and add them to your basket
by checking the boxes beside the relevant records in the search results list.

*Remove from consideration*. The record will no longer be included in the merge.

. Leave the merge profile as "Keep Local Fields".  Any 050, 055, 092, 590, 595, 690, 852, and 856 fields 
from non-lead records will be moved to the lead record.
+

follow Sitka http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Cataloguing Policy].

[NOTE]
=====
While you can edit call numbers and/or items from the merge screen, Co-op Support recommends you focus 
on bibliographic records here. After the merging is done, you can edit your call numbers and items through the
Holdings Editor.

[CAUTION]
=========
Deleted records will remain in a record Bucket. We recommend you merge records right after you add 
them to the bucket. If you merge them later, good practice is to check the *Deleted* column in the bucket  
before merging to avoid merging records into a deleted record.
