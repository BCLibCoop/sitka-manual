Merging Bibliogrpahic Records

https://goo.gl/91kp4e[Sitka Training Video - Merge Duplicate Bibliographic Records (7:31)]

This lesson will demonstrate merging bibliographic records in the catalogue. A common application for this functionality is to replace brief records with full records to keep one bibliographic record for one title. 

Any volume and copy records or holds associated with the brief record will be transferred to the full record upon merging.

. Records are merged via *Record Bucket*. You need to have a bucket for the records you wish to merge. To create record bucket, refer to  xref:create-record-bucket[] for detailed instructions. In the examples below the bucket is named "merge117036601".

. Identify records to be merged and add them to the bucket. See xref:add-record-to-bucket[] for detailed instructions.

. Retrieve the bucket by selecting *Cataloguing -> Record Buckets*.

. Click the down-pointed arrow besides *Bucket* to list, then select the bucket containing the records to be merged.

======
You may edit volumes and/or copies from merge screen. However, Co-op support suggests you focus on bibliogrpahic records on merge screen. After the merging is done, you may edit your volume/copy on Holdings View.
