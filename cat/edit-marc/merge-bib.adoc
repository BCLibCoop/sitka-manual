Merging Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://youtu.be/Why90G2qizg[*Sitka Training Video - Merging Duplicate Bibliographic Records (5:10)*]

Each discrete bibliographic title in Evergreen should have a single record that all libraries 
attach their holdings to. When a title has multiple records library staff with 
sufficient cataloguing knowledge can merge duplicate records together as per 
https://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka's Cataloguing Policy] for 
https://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_editing_bibliographic_records.html#_existing_records[Editing
 Bibliographic Records].



Any call number and item records, or holds, associated with the non-lead records will be transferred to 
the lead record upon merging.

. Add the desired records to a record bucket.  See xref:_adding_records_to_a_record_bucket[].

[NOTE]
======
When creating your bucket Co-op Support recommends using the title of the records you are merging.
======
. Retrieve the bucket by selecting *Cataloguing -> Record Buckets* on the menu bar.
+
. From the list of your buckets click on the name of the bucket containing the records
you are merging.

. If after comparing the MARC records you determine that any of them are not a match for merging click 
*Remove from consideration*. The record will no longer be included in the merge.
+

. Leave the merge profile as "Keep Local Fields".  Any 050, 055, 092, 590, 595, 690, 852, and 856 fields 
from non-lead records will be moved to the lead record.
+

. Edit buttons will appear for the lead record. You can edit the record if edits are necessary. 
Any edits need to follow 
https://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka's Cataloguing Policy] for 
https://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_editing_bibliographic_records.html#_existing_records[Editing
 Bibliographic Records].

[NOTE]
=====
While you can edit call numbers and/or items from the merge screen, Co-op Support recommends you focus 
on bibliographic records here. After the merging is done, you can edit your call numbers and items through the
xref:_holdings_editor[Holdings Editor].
=====


[CAUTION]
=========
Deleted records will remain in a record Bucket. We recommend you merge records right after you add 
them to the bucket. If you merge them later, good practice is to check the *Deleted* column in the bucket  
before merging to avoid merging records into a deleted record.
