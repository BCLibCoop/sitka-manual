Deleting Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sitka's Evergreen will automatically delete records when the last item attached to the record is deleted.

Records that are imported or created in Evergreen but never have a holding attached or a scoped 856 added 
are automatically deleted when they've been in the catalogue for more than 3 months.

You can delete a MARC record directly from the *MARC Edit* tab in the bibliographic record.

. Search the catalogue for a record that you need to delete, as described
in xref:_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes[].
. Click on the *MARC Edit* tab.
. Click *Delete Record*.

Undeleting Bibliographic Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
