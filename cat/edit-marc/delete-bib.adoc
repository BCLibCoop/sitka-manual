Sitka's Evergreen will automatically delete records when the last item attached to the record 
is deleted.

Records that are imported or created in Evergreen but never have a holding attached or a 
scoped 856 field added are automatically deleted when they've been in the catalogue for 
more than 3 months.

Records with holdings attached, physical or electronic, cannot be deleted.
