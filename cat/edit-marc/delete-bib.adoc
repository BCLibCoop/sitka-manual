Deleting Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to cascading record deletion on sole copies, you may find you do not need to delete bibliographic 
records very often, as Evergreen does this for you.

Remember that Sitka's Evergreen is configured to always delete a MARC record when the only 
copy attached to it is deleted and you can only delete a MARC record if there are no holdings attached 
to it. This may happen if you have imported a new MARC record in error, and have not 
attached any holdings to it, or some other error or conversion circumstance that leaves a 
MARC record in the database with no holdings attached.

You can delete a MARC record directly from the *MARC Edit* tab in the bibliographic record.

. Find the record in the catalogue and go to Record Details, and click on the *MARC Edit* tab.

. Click *Delete Record*.

. Record is now deleted and inactive and only retrievable by a TCN (title control number) search 
or bibliographic record id (presented at deletion confirmation prompt).

You can also delete bibliographic records from a Record Bucket.

Undeleting Bibliographic Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deleted records can be undeleted if you know the record ID.

. Retrieve the record by its database ID.
