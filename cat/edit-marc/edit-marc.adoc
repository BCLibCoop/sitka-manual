* The fields, indicators, and values are in fixed positions in the Flat Text Editor.
* Each MARC field begins with a = followed by the 3 digit tag for the field.
* If there is no value for an indicator "\" is used to fill the space.
* The "\" is also used in the control fields (Leader, 006, 007, and 008) for characters where 
no value is specified.
