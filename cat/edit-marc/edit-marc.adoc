[TIP]
=====
On Flat-Text Editor, each line stands for a tag. The tags, indicators and their values are at fixed positions. If there is no value at a position, you will see "\" as a spacing taker. For positionally defined tags, such as 007 or 008, you will see "\" in the field content area, too. You need to replace it with the content you want to put in, when necessary.
