Exporting Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you may want to export MARC records from Evergreen. Evergreen allows you to do so 
via the Record Bucket and the MARC Batch Import/Export interface. You may include the holdings 
information in the MARC records. Based on Sitka's configuration, the holdings information will be in 
tag 852, including the item's circulating library, shelving location, barcode, call number, status, 
and others saved in the item record.

MARC records can be exported from Evergreen in MARC XML, UNIMARC, MARC21/USMARC or Evergreen Record Entry format.
The exported records can be encoded in either UTF-8 or MARC8.
