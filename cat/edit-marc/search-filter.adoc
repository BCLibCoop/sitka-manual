Search Filters and Format Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen utilizes the coded information entered into the leader and control fields in the
MARC record for search filters and format icons.  These fields need to be accurately coded
so that the correct format icons display and expected records are included in
search results.  See xref:_editing_the_leader_and_control_fields[] for instructions on 
editing these fields.

Format Filter Groups and Format Icons are configured at the Sitka level.

* *Type* is Leader position 06 - Type of record
* *Bib Level* is Leader position 07 - Bibliographic level
* *Form* is 008 position 23 - Form of item , except when Type = e, f, or g then it's position 29
* *Speed* is 007 position 03 - Speed
* *Video Format* is 007 position 04 - Videorecording Format

Search Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Languages* - relies on characters 35-37 of the 008 field.
*Audience* - relies on character 22 of the 008 field (for the relevant material configurations).
*Literary Forms* - relies on character 33 of the 008 field (only applicable to books).
*Shelving Location* - will display a list of the search library's shelving locations
*Publication Date* - relies on characters 07-10 of the 008 field.
*Formats* - relies on the characters shows in the table below.

The format filter is used by the catalogue to allow staff and patrons to limit their search by material
format. The following table shows the fixed fields associated with each format filter value.
