Search Filters and Format Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen utilizes the coded information entered into the leader and control fields in the
MARC record for search filters and format icons.  These fields need to be accurately coded
so that the correct format icons display and expected records are included in
search results.

[NOTE]
======
The new catalogue presently includes search filters that are different from those available in the
traditional catalogue.  Further work is required in the new catalogue to enable it to use our custom filters.
======

Evergreen looks at the following positions in the leader and control fields:

Format Filter Groups and Format Icons are configured at the Sitka level.

* item_type (Type) is Leader position 06

* bib_level (BLvl) is Leader position 07

* Date1 is 008 position 07-10

* item_form (Form) is 008 position 23, except when item_type is g, 008
position 29

* vr_format is 007 position 04

* sr_format is 007 position 03

Search Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Languages* - relies on characters 35-37 of the 088 field.

*Audience* - relies on character 22 of the 008 field (for the relevant material configurations).

*Literary Forms* - relies on character 33 of the 008 field (only applicable to books).

*Publication Date* - relies on characters 07-10 of the 008 field.

*Formats* - currently includes formats not included in our regular format list.  These are marked as 
_(hidden)_ in the list.

The format filter is used by the catalogue to allow staff and patrons to limit their search by material
format. The following table shows the fixed fields associated with each format filter value.
