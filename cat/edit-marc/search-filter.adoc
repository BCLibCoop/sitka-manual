Search Filters and Format Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen utilizes the coded information entered into the leader and control fields in the
MARC record for search filters and format icons.  These fields need to be accurately coded
so that the correct format icons display and expected records are included in
search results.  See xref:_editing_the_leader_and_control_fields[] for instructions on 
editing these fields.

The terminology used in the Search Filter and Format Icon tables to indicate characters
of the leader and control fields are:

* *Type* is Leader position 06 - Type of record
* *Bib Level* is Leader position 07 - Bibliographic level
* *Form* is 008 position 23 - Form of item , except when Type = e, f, or g then it's position 29
* *Speed* is 007 position 03 - Speed
* *Video Format* is 007 position 04 - Videorecording Format

* *Shelving Location* - will display a list of the search library's shelving locations
* *Publication Date* - relies on characters 07-10 of the 008 field.
