Adding Holdings to Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[CAUTION]
=========

Make sure your browser allows Evergreen to open pop-ups or the Holdings Editor will not appear.
  See xref:_browser_configuration[].

Co-op Support recommends all cataloguers adjust their 
xref:_holdings_editor_preferences[Holdings Editor Preferences] and set up 
xref:_creating_holdings_templates[holdings templates] before starting to add holdings.

Detailed information on the Holdings Editor can be found in xref:_holdings_editor[].
