Adding Holdings to Title Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Search the catalogue for a record that matches the item in hand, as described in xref:_Searching_the_Database_for_Cataloguing_Purposes[]. If you do not find a match, refer to the Sitka Cataloguing Policy at  http://sitka.bclibraries.ca/governance/sitka-policy/ for recommendations on required procedures.

Adding multiple copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


If you add multiple copies and they do not share the values in one or more item attributes, you may temporarily store copies to  *Completed Copies* tab, while working on others.

. After you type in the barcode(s), copies are dispalyed under *Working Copies*. Select those copies that share all the item attributes. Fill up the item attributes for these copies. Click on *Store Selected*.

+
. Completed copies can still be edited. Go to *Completed Copies* tab. Select those you want to edit, click on *Edit Selected*.
+

. Copies can be saved on *Completed Copies* tab, too.
