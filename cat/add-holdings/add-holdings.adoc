=========

Adding Holdings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Search the catalogue for a record that matches the item in hand, as described
in xref:_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes[].
.. If you do not find a match,
refer to the http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka Cataloguing Policy] for
recommendations on required procedures.
. Click on the title link to open the record.
+

+
. Complete the required fields for both the call number and item records.
.. You can configure the default fields displayed in Holdings Editor. Click on *Defaults* on Holdings Editor.
See xref:_volume_copy_defaults[] for more information.
..  By default, a new item has *In Process* status, unless you choose a different one when creating it.
Item must be checked in to become *Available* and to create item's *Active Date*.
.. Refer to
xref:_working_on_item_attributes[] for information about individual fields in an item record.
.. To ensure data consistency, we recommend using holding templates. Select one from the dropdown list,
then click on *Apply*. Refer to xref:_volume_copy_template[] for more information on creating and using
holding templates.
+
. Once done, click on *Save & Exit*. The pop-up tab is closed.


Adding Holdings to Multiple Branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Go to the *Holdings View* tab and select the branches you'd like to add items to.
+
.. If you do not select a branch, the default owning and circulating library is your login working location.
+

and will include the Call Number/Volume Editor.

[TIP]
=====

Make sure both the *Show empty call numbers* and *Show empty libraries* checkboxes are selected in order to
display branches without items on the library list.

=====

You can also add call numbers for additional branches from within the Call Number/Volume Editor.

. Click in the library field beside the *Add call number* button and select the branch from the drop down menu.
. Click *Add call number*.

Adding Items to an Existing Call Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. If your library has multiple call numbers and you want to an new item to a particular one, 
select the call number on the *Holdings View* tab.
. Click *Add Holdings*.
+

+
. The Holdings Editor will open up in a new tab 
and will include the Call Number/Volume Editor.

Adding a Call Number without an Item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you may need to create a call number record without any item. For example, you may want to 
move one of two regular collection items to reference, which will use a different call number prefix, 
or catalogue a pre-catalogued item.

. Find the title record, then click on *Holdings View*,  select your library, go to *Actions* list, 
and scroll to *Add* to select *Add Call Numbers*.
+

. Complete the call number fields, then click *Save & Exit*.
+

[TIP]
=====
Evergreen does not allow one library to have two identical individual call numbers under 
one title. When saving new items or editing existing items, items sharing the same call number 
are grouped under one call number record. This call number can be edited via any item under it, 
and any edit affects all items. If an item needs a different call number, you need to create a 
new call number record, then transfer the item to it.
=====



Adding Multiple Items to One Call Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. To add multiple items to one library on Holdings Editor, use the arrow in the *Items* column to increase the number. Extra lines show up for more barcodes.
+
image::images/cat/add-holdings-3a.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. Type or scan in the barcodes for each item.

NOTE: *Save & Exit* is greyed out until barcodes are entered.

Working on Multiple Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you add multiple items, and they do not share the values in one or more item attributes, you can select and work on those that share item attributes as a group. You can also temporarily store some items to *Completed Items* tab, then work on those on *Working Items* tab, which share the same attributes. Save and exit when all items are done.

. After you enter the barcode(s), items are displayed under *Working Items*. Select those items that share the same item attribute values. Complete the item attributes for these items. To move them to *Completed Items* tab, click on *Store Selected*.
+
image::images/cat/add-holdings-5.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. Completed items may be further edited, if needed. Select those you want to edit, then click on *Edit Selected*.
+
image::images/cat/add-holdings-7.png[]
+
. Selected items are moved back to the *Working Items* tab where you can edit them. After editing, you can store them in the *Completed Items* tab, or click *Save & Exit* when all items are done.
+
. You can *Save Completed* items or *Save & Exit* from *Completed Items* tab. When you choose to *Save Completed*, item records are created in the database, but they remain on the *Completed Items* tab.
+

[CAUTION]
=========
* Stored items on *Completed Items* tab are not saved in the database until you click on *Save & Exit* or *Save Completed*. They are available on the current Holdings Editor screen only. If you close the browser tab without saving them, you will lose them.
+
* *Save Completed* will save those items on *Completed Items* tab only. Those on *Working Items* tab will be considered discarded, though they do not disappear.
