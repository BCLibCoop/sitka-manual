Adding a Single Volume/Copy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Search the catalogue for a record that matches the item in hand, as described in xref:_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes[]. If you do not find a match, refer to the  http://sitka.bclibraries.ca/governance/sitka-policy/[Sitka Cataloguing Policy] for recommendations on required procedures. If you do find a match, proceed to next step.

. When the record details are loaded, click *Holdings View*.

CAUTION: Make sure your browser allows Evergreen to open pop-ups.
+
[TIP]
=====
* For multi-branch libraries, you may need to select the branch before clicking Add Copies. If you do not select one, the default owning and circulating library is your login working location.
+

* Make sure both *Show empty volumes* and *Show empty libraries* checkboxes are selected in order to display libraries without copies on the library list.
=====

. Complete the required fields in both volume and copy records. Refer to xref:_working_on_copy_attributes[] for information about individual fields in a copy record. To ensure data consistency, using copy templates is recommended. Select one from the dropdown list, then click on *Apply*. Refer to xref:_volume_copy_template[] for more information.

. Once done, click on *Save & Exit*. The pop-up tab is closed. Use the browser function key to refresh the screen to see new items.


[TIP]
=====
* By default, a new item has In Process status, unless you choose a different one when creating it. Item must be checked in to become Available. Item's *Active Date* will be filled when it leaves In Process status.
+
* You may configure the default displayed fields in volume copy editor. Click on *Defaults* on volume copy editor. See xref:_volume_copy_defaults[] for more information.

. Type/scan in barcodes for each copy.

NOTE: *Save & Exit* is greyed out before barcodes are not filled up.

Working on Multiple Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you add multiple copies and they do not share the values in one or more item attributes, you may select and work on those that share item attributes as a group. You may also temporarily store some items to *Completed Copies* tab, then work on those on Working Copies tab, which share the same attributes. Save and exit when all copies are done.

. After you enter the barcode(s), copies are displayed under *Working Copies*. Select those copies that share the same item attribute values. Complete the item attributes for these copies. To move them to Completed Copies tab, click on *Store Selected*.
+

+

+
image::images/cat/add-holdings-7.png[]
+
. Selected copies are moved back to the *Working Copies* tab where you can edit them. After editing, you can store them to the *Completed Copies* tab, or click *Save & Exit* when all copies are done.
+
. You can *Save Completed* copies or *Save & Exit* from *Completed Copies* tab. When you choose to *Save Completed*, copy records are created in the database, but they remain on the *Completed Copies* tab.
+

[CAUTION]
=========
* Stored copies on *Completed Copies* tab are *not* saved in the database until you click on *Save & Exit* or *Save Completed*. They are available on the current Volume Copy Creator only. If you close the browser tab without saving them, you will lose them.
+
* *Save Completed* will save those copies on Completed Copies tab only. Those on Working Copies tab will be considered discarded, though they do not disappear.

Adding volumes/copies functions are also available on the *Actions* dropdown list, or right click your mouse when an entry on the library list is selected.
