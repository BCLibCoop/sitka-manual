Adding Holdings for Non-physical Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to catalogue non-physical resources in Evergreen. Recommended process is to use specially coded MARC records as described in xref:cataloguing_nonphysical_resources[]. Alternatively you may add dummy holdings to a MARC record, using the same steps as adding physical holdings as described in prior section. Adding dummy holdings will scope your non-physical resources to your public catalogue. If you use dummy holdings, it is important to use item barcodes from within your designated barcode range.
