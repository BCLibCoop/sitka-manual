Managing Record Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beneath the header are shortcuts to display different sets of buckets:

* _My buckets_ shows all buckets that you created or that you own directly.
* _Favorites_ shows the buckets that you have marked as a favourite.
* _Recent_ shows buckets that you have recently viewed.
* _Shared with others_ shows buckets that you have shared with other staff users or libraries.
* _Shared with me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or shared with your 
library, for which you have permission to edit.
* _Visible to me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or 
shared with your library, for which you have permission to view.

Transfering Bucket Ownership
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transfer Bucket Ownership - this opens a modal which will prompt you to enter a barcode, or 
search for a user, to transfer bucket ownership. Depending on your permissions, once you 
transfer a bucket you may lose editing or viewing privileges for that bucket. Administrators 
can transfer buckets for other users, even if the administrator doesnâ€™t directly own the bucket.

Creating Carousels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sitka does not currently use the Carousels feature in the Evergreen public catalogue.

Libraries using LibPress can find information on using carousels in the 
https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/highlights/sitka-carousels/[Sitka Carousels] section
of the https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/[LibPress manual].

Exporting Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action allows staff to export all of the records in the selected buckets. See xref:_exporting_marc_records_via_a_record_bucket[].

MARC Batch Edit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MARC Batch Edit function is not used by Sitka and library staff cannot use it to batch edit 
MARC records. The MARC Batch Edit action will take staff to the MARC Batch Edit interface but 
permissions will prevent any batch edits. Please contact Co-op Support for assistance 
with batch editing.




Staff can share their record buckets with other staff at the library, at another branch, or at another 
library by sharing the bucket ID.

Finding a Record Bucket ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Go to *Cataloguing -> Record Buckets*.

. From the *Buckets* drop down menu select the bucket you would like to share.
