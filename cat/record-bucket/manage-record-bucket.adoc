Managing Record Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Viewing Record Buckets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Beneath the header are shortcuts to display different sets of buckets:

* _My buckets_ shows all buckets that you created or that you own directly.
* _Favorites_ shows the buckets that you have marked as a favourite.
* _Recent_ shows buckets that you have recently viewed.
* _Shared with others_ shows buckets that you have shared with other staff users or libraries.
* _Shared with me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or shared with your 
library, for which you have permission to edit.
* _Visible to me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or 
shared with your library, for which you have permission to view.

Bucket ID Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buckets can be searched for and retrieved if you know the bucket ID.

Catalogue Search 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While there is a catalogue search available from within the Record Bucket interface it is 
recommended that staff go to *Cataloguing -> Search Catalogue* as there are more options available 
for filtering and limiting your search by starting in the staff catalogue.

There are a number of actions that can be performed on buckets available from the 
*Actions* menu.

Add to Favorites/Remove from Favorites
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_favourite]]


These actions allow to add and remove the selected bucket(s) to/from your Favorites list. 
Favorited buckets will populate 
your Favorites view in the buckets interface, as well as in the staff catalogue buckets tab.


Edit Buckets
++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_edit]]

This actions allows you to edit the bucket details, including name, description, and whether or not 
the bucket is public.

Delete Bucket(s)
++++++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_delete]]

This action allows you to delete the selected bucket(s).  A pop-up will ask you to confirm 
the deletion. You can only delete buckets that you own or for which you have editing permissions.

Share Buckets
+++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_share]]

This action allows you to share the bucket with other users.

*Share Bucket* - this opens a modal which will allow you to share the bucket with specific 
users and/or organizational units. You can separately add users with view-only permissions
and users with view and edit permissions. All buckets shared with an organizational unit will 
be editable by those with bucket editing privileges at that location

Transfering Bucket Ownership
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_transfer_owner]]

This action allows you to transfer a bucket to another user.

. In the pop-up that appears click *Search for user* to find the account you wish to transfer 
the bucket ownership to.

Depending on your permissions, once you transfer a bucket you may lose editing or viewing privileges 
for that bucket. Administrators can transfer buckets for other users, even if the administrator 
doesnâ€™t directly own the bucket.

Export Records
++++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_export]]

This action allows staff to export all of the records in the selected buckets. See 
xref:_exporting_marc_records_via_a_record_bucket[].

Upload Records
++++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_upload]]

This action allows staff to upload or copy/paste 
bibliographic IDs to the selected bucket. See LINK TO GO HERE

Creating Carousels
++++++++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_carousel]]

Sitka does not currently use the Carousels feature in the Evergreen public catalogue.

Libraries using LibPress can find information on using carousels in the 
https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/highlights/sitka-carousels/[Sitka Carousels] section
of the https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/[LibPress manual].



MARC Batch Edit
+++++++++++++++
[[_bucket_action_marc_batch]]

The MARC Batch Edit function is not used by Sitka and library staff cannot use it to batch edit 
MARC records. The MARC Batch Edit action will take staff to the MARC Batch Edit interface but 
permissions will prevent any batch edits. Please contact Co-op Support for assistance 
with batch editing.
