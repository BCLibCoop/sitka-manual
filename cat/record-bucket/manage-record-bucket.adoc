Managing Record Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Viewing Record Buckets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Beneath the header are shortcuts to display different sets of buckets:

* _My buckets_ shows all buckets that you created or that you own directly.
* _Favorites_ shows the buckets that you have marked as a favourite.
* _Recent_ shows buckets that you have recently viewed.
* _Shared with others_ shows buckets that you have shared with other staff users or libraries.
* _Shared with me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or shared with your 
library, for which you have permission to edit.
* _Visible to me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or 
shared with your library, for which you have permission to view.

Bucket ID Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buckets can be searched for and retrieved if you know the bucket ID.

Catalogue Search 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While there is a catalogue search available from within the Record Bucket interface it is 
recommended that staff go to *Cataloguing -> Search Catalogue* as there are more options available 
for filtering and limiting your search by starting in the staff catalogue.

Creating Carousels
++++++++++++++++++
[[_record_bucket_action_carousel]]

Sitka does not currently use the Carousels feature in the Evergreen public catalogue.

Libraries using LibPress can find information on using carousels in the 
https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/highlights/sitka-carousels/[Sitka Carousels] section
of the https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/[LibPress manual].



MARC Batch Edit
+++++++++++++++
[[_record_bucket_action_marc_batch]]

The MARC Batch Edit function is not used by Sitka and library staff cannot use it to batch edit 
MARC records. The MARC Batch Edit action will take staff to the MARC Batch Edit interface but 
permissions will prevent any batch edits. Please contact Co-op Support for assistance 
with batch editing.
