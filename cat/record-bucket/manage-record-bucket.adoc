Managing Record Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Viewing Record Buckets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Beneath the header are shortcuts to display different sets of buckets:

* _My buckets_ shows all buckets that you created or that you own directly.
* _Favorites_ shows the buckets that you have marked as a favourite.
* _Recent_ shows buckets that you have recently viewed.
* _Shared with others_ shows buckets that you have shared with other staff users or libraries.
* _Shared with me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or shared with your 
library, for which you have permission to edit.
* _Visible to me_ shows buckets that have either been directly shared with you or 
shared with your library, for which you have permission to view.

Bucket ID Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buckets can be searched for and retrieved if you know the bucket ID.

Catalogue Search 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While there is a catalogue search available from within the Record Bucket interface it is 
recommended that staff go to *Cataloguing -> Search Catalogue* as there are more options available 
for filtering and limiting your search by starting in the staff catalogue.

Record Bucket Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a number of actions that can be performed on buckets available from the 
*Actions* menu.

Favourites
++++++++++

*Add to Favorites* - adds the selected bucket to your Favorites list. Favorited buckets will populate your Favorites view in the buckets interface, as well as in the staff catalog buckets tab.
*Remove from Favorites* - removes the selected bucket from your Favorites list.


Editing Buckets
+++++++++++++++

*Edit Bucket* - allows you to edit bucket details like name, description, and whether or not the bucket is public

Deleting Buckets
++++++++++++++++

*Delete Bucket(s)* - prompts you to confirm deletion of one or several buckets. You can only delete buckets that you own, or for which you have editing permissions.

Sharing Buckets
+++++++++++++++

*Share Bucket* - this opens a modal which will allow you to share the bucket with specific 
users and/or organizational units. You can separately add users with view-only permissions
and users with view and edit permissions. All buckets shared with an organizational unit will 
be editable by those with bucket editing privileges at that location

Transfering Bucket Ownership
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*Transfer Bucket Ownership* - this opens a modal which will prompt you to enter a barcode, or 
search for a user, to transfer bucket ownership. Depending on your permissions, once you 
transfer a bucket you may lose editing or viewing privileges for that bucket. Administrators 
can transfer buckets for other users, even if the administrator doesnâ€™t directly own the bucket.

Exporting Records
+++++++++++++++++

*Export Records* - This action allows staff to export all of the records in the selected 
buckets. See xref:_exporting_marc_records_via_a_record_bucket[].

Upload Records
++++++++++++++

*Upload Records* - this opens a modal which will allow you to either upload or copy/paste 
bibliographic IDs or TCNs to the selected bucket. This is described in detail below in

Creating Carousels
++++++++++++++++++

Sitka does not currently use the Carousels feature in the Evergreen public catalogue.

Libraries using LibPress can find information on using carousels in the 
https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/highlights/sitka-carousels/[Sitka Carousels] section
of the https://help.libraries.coop/libpress/[LibPress manual].



MARC Batch Edit
+++++++++++++++

The MARC Batch Edit function is not used by Sitka and library staff cannot use it to batch edit 
MARC records. The MARC Batch Edit action will take staff to the MARC Batch Edit interface but 
permissions will prevent any batch edits. Please contact Co-op Support for assistance 
with batch editing.




Staff can share their record buckets with other staff at the library, at another branch, or at another 
library by sharing the bucket ID.
