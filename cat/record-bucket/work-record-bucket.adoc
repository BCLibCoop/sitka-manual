======
The Batch Edit function is not used by Sitka and library staff cannot use it to batch edit MARC records. 
The Batch Edit button exists in record buckets and will take staff to the MARC Batch Edit 
interface but permissions will prevent any batch edits. Please contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] 
for assistance with batch editing.
