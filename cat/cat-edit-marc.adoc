Maintaining Bibliographic Records
---------------------------------

The searchability of the staff and public catalogues relies on information being entered
and coded correctly in the MARC records. 

Evergreen has both the xref:_enhanced_marc_editor[Enhanced MARC Editor] and the 
xref:_flat_text_editor[Flat Text Editor] which can be used 
when xref:_creating_new_bibliographic_records[creating], 
xref:_importing_bibliographic_records_via_z39_50_interface[importing], 
xref:_merging_bibliographic_records[merging], 
xref:_editing_marc_records[editing], and 
xref:_deleting_bibliographic_records[deleting] bibliographic records.  Cataloguers 
can use either editor or both when working with records.

Before working with bibliographic records in Sitka's Evergreen cataloguers must be 
familiar with 
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka's Cataloguing Policy].
