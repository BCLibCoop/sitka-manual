Keyword Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When searching the catalogue for cataloguing purposes the Numeric Search should be preferred over the Keyword Search.
Libraries that catalogue non-bibliographic items (laptops, museum passes, cake pans, etc.) that don't use standard 
identifiers, like ISBN, may need to use the Keyword Search when adding additional items to these records.

. To search the catalogue for holdings select *Cataloguing* -> *Search the Catalogue*.

. When searching for cataloguing purposes it is important to ensure 
that you search the entire consortium.

[TIP]
======
It is possible to search ISBNs by Keyword, but results may not be exhaustive. 
We recommend using *Numeric Search* when searching for ISBN or other standard identifiers.  
Refer to xref:_numeric_search.html[].
