Keyword Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When searching the catalogue for cataloguing purposes the Numeric Search should be preferred over the Keyword Search.
Libraries that catalogue non-bibliographic items (laptops, museum passes, cake pans, etc.) that don't use standard 
identifiers, like ISBN, may need to use the Keyword Search when adding additional items to these records.

. To search the catalogue for holdings select *Cataloging* -> *Search the Catalog (Experimnental)*.

. When searching for cataloguing purposes it is important to ensure 
that you search the entire consortium.

[TIP]
======
* It is possible to search ISBNs by Keyword, but results may not be exhaustive. We recommend using *Numeric Search* as described above.

* If an OCLC number is nine digits then Evergreen uses ocn as a prefix. For example:  ocn123456789.

* If an OCLC number is less than 8 digits then Evergreen uses ocm as a prefix.  In addition Evergreen will automatically prefix the number with zeros so that it is nine digits.  For example:  ocm01234567, or ocm00123456.

* If searching a LCCN do not use a hyphen,  add a 0 in place of a hyphen, e.g. 2001001234.
