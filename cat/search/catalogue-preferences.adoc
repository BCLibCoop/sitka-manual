.. *Default Search Library* This determines what library is searched from the advanced search screen 
and portal page by default. You can override this setting when you are actually searching by selecting a 
different library. One recommendation is to set the search library to the highest point you would 
normally want to search.
.. *Preferred Library* This is used to show copies and electronic resource URIs regardless of the library 
searched. One recommendation is to set this to your home library so that local copies show up first 
in search results.
.. *Default Search Pane*  You can change which search pane is loaded by default when 
opening a new catalogue window.  Choose from Keyword Search, Numeric Search, MARC Search, Browse, and Shelf Browse.
.. *Search Results Per Page* You can enter the number of search results that display per page.  
We recommend keeping this number under 200. 
.. *Exclude Electronic Resources* Checking this adds the checkbox to the main search form.
