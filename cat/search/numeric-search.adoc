[TIP]
======
* UPC's are only recognized by the Numeric Search when the 024 indicator 1 is coded as "1".
* If searching a LCCN do not use a hyphen,  add a 0 in place of a hyphen, e.g. 2001001234.
* If an OCLC number is nine digits then Evergreen uses ocn as a prefix. For example:  ocn123456789.
* If an OCLC number is less than 8 digits then Evergreen uses ocm as a prefix.  In addition Evergreen 
will automatically prefix the number with zeros so that it is nine digits.  For example:  ocm01234567, 
or ocm00123456.
