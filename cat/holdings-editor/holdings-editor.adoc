The Holdings Editor is used to create or edit call number and item records. 

It can be accessed:

* from within a bibliographic record by going to *Holdings View* and selecting the appropriate option from
the *Actions* menu.
* from within a bibliographic record by clicking *Edit* on the *Item Table* tab.
* from within an item bucket by selecting the appropriate option from
the *Actions* menu.
* by scanning an item into *Item Status* and selecting the appropriate option from

[NOTE]
======
The Holdings Editor can display the Holdings Details and Item Attributes as separate tabs or the
two can be unified into a single tab as shown above.  This is done via the setting _Unified Holdings,
Item Attributes Display, and Item Templates_ on the 
xref:_holdings_editor_preferences[Preferences] tab.
