Record Bucket
-------------

Record Bucket allows you to build a list of titles that you may process in batch. It is also the interface for merging records. Records, even after being deleted, remain in a bucket until they are removed from it. 

We will demonstrate how to create and manage bibliographic record buckets. The steps used for copy buckets are similar. It is very important when working with buckets to ensure you are working with the correct type of record for the corresponding bucket. You cannot add copy records to bibliographic record buckets and vice versa.

Creating Record Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



There are two ways to create a record bucket. You can either create a bucket first, without accessing any records, or you can access a record and choose to create the bucket from that view. We will demonstrate both methods here.

*Creating a Record Bucket on Record Buckets* view

. Select *Cataloging -> Record Buckets* from the menu bar.

. Select *New Bucket* from the *Buckets* dropdown list.

Only buckets created by the login account are listed. But those created by other people can be retrieved via bucket number, if shared with you. Click *Shared Bucket* to type in the number to retrieve it.

*Creating a Record Bucket when Adding a Record to a Bucket*

You can also create a bucket from within a record. Search for, retrieve, and display any bibliographic record, then choose *Other Actions -> Add to Bucket*.

Working with Records in a Record Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may apply the following functions to selected copies in a bucket. 

* *Show Selected Records in Catalogue*
* *Delete Selected Records from Catalogue*
* *Merge Selected Records* (Refer to xref:_merging_bibliographic_records[])
* *Export Records* (Refer to xref:export-marc-from-bucket[])


To apply these functions, retrieve the bucket, select titles, then choose the function from the *Actions* list. 

CAUTION: Co-op support strongly suggests *not* using *Transfer Title Holds* as it transfers all holds, including other libraries', to the selected title.
