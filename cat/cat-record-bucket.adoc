Record Buckets

(((Record Buckets)))
(((Buckets, Record)))

Record buckets are containers that can be used to group MARC records.  Once records are in a bucket you
can perform batch actions on the records including xref:_merging_bibliographic_records[merging], 
xref:_deleting_records_via_a_record_bucket[deleting], and xref:_exporting_marc_records_via_a_record_bucket[exporting] the records. Buckets
can also be shared with Co-op Support for batch editing assistance and troubleshooting. Buckets can also be used for matching when importing records via the Batch Import function.
