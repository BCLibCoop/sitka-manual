Record Buckets

(((Record Buckets)))
(((Buckets, Record)))

Record buckets are containers that can be used to group MARC records.  Once records are in a bucket you
can perform batch actions on the records including merging, deleting, and exporting the records. Buckets
can also be shared with Co-op Support for batch editing assistance and troubleshooting. 

Buckets can also be used for matching when importing records via the Batch Import function.
