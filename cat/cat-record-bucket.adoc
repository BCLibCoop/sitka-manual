Record Buckets
--------------
(((Record Buckets)))
(((Buckets, Record)))

Record buckets are containers that can be used to group MARC records.  Once records are in a bucket you
can perform batch actions on the records including xref:_merging_bibliographic_records[merging], 
xref:_deleting_records_via_a_record_bucket[deleting], and xref:_exporting_marc_records_via_a_record_bucket[exporting] the records. Buckets
can also be shared with Co-op Support for batch editing assistance and troubleshooting. 

Buckets can also be used for matching when importing records via the Batch Import function.

Working with Records in a Record Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once records have been xref:_adding_records_to_a_record_bucket[added to a record bucket] there are 
several functions that can be performed.

Managing Record Bucket Contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several options on the *Actions* menu allow staff to manage the contents of their bucket.

image::images/cat/buckets/record-bucket-manage-1.png[]

* Show Selected Records in Catalogue
** This action will open the selected records in the staff catalogue in new tabs.
+
[NOTE]
======
If only one record opens your browser is blocking pop-ups.

image::images/cat/buckets/record-bucket-manage-2.png[]
======
+
* Remove Selected Records from Bucket
** This action will remove the records from the bucket; this does not delete the records from the catalogue.
* Move Selected Records to Pending Records
** This action will move the selected records to the *Pending Records* tab so they can be added to a different 
record bucket. 

Managing Records in a Record Bucket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several options on the *Actions* menu allow staff to manage the records in their bucket.

image::images/cat/buckets/record-bucket-manage-3.png[]

* Delete Selected Records from Catalogue
** This action deletes the selected records from the catalogue.Records remain in a bucket after they 
are marked as deleted in the database.
** See xref:_deleting_records_via_a_record_bucket[].
* Transfer Title Holds
** This action should never be used as it will transfer title holds for all libraries. 
** See xref:_transferring_title_holds[] for information on transferring title holds for your library.
* Merge Selected Records
** This action allows staff to merge multiple records into a single record.
** See xref:_merging_bibliographic_records[].
* Export Records
** This action allows staff to export the records from a bucket.
** See xref:_exporting_marc_records_via_a_record_bucket[].

[NOTE]
======
The Batch Edit function is not used by Sitka and library staff cannot use it to batch edit MARC records. 
The Batch Edit button exists in record buckets and will take staff to the MARC Batch Edit 
interface but permissions will prevent any batch edits. Please contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] 
for assistance with batch editing.
