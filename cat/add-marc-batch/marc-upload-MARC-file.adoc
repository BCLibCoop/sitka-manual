Uploading MARC Record Files With Holdings Included
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some vendors can include holdings information in the MARC records which Evergreen
can use to create new items or update attributes for existing items.  This 
information is generally found in a 9XX or 852 field.  

Contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] before loading records 
from a new vendor who supplies holding information as a _Holdings
Import Profile_ will need to be set up. 

[CAUTION]
=========
You need to contact Co-op Support for holding information format 
before asking your vendors to include it in the MARC records. Holdings may not 
be loaded if the format does not match Sitka's holding profile.
