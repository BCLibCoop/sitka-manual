| Field | Description | Required | Note
| Apply/Create Form Templates | Templates can be set up for different vendors or types of
records. | No | See xref:_import_templates[] for instruction on setting up templates.
| Record Type | Indicates the type of records being imported. | Yes | Defaults to 
_Bibliographic Records_ which are the only type of records currently imported here.
| Select or Create Queue |This groups your record into a queue so you can work with them. 
| Yes | Queues are linked to the match sets and holdings import profile. You cannot change 
a record match set or holdings import profile once it has been set for a queue.
| Record Match Set | This tells Evergreen what to look for to determine if an incoming 
record matches an existing record. | Yes | Cataloguers should always use _SitkaMatch_ unless
otherwise instructed by Co-op Support.  It matches on the 901c 
(record id),  020a (ISBN), 022a (ISSN), or 035a (System Control Number). 
| Holdings Import Profile | This is used when the MARC records include holdings information
for Evergreen to create items with. | No | Please contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if your vendor provides
holdings information in your MARC records.
| Merge Profile | This tells Evergreen which record to use as the lead record and what fields
to preserve from the non-lead record. | No | See 
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_batch_loading_bibliographic_records.html#_library_specific_batch_loading[Sitka's 
Library Specific Batch Loading policy] for information on which profile to select.
| Insufficient Quality Fall-Through Profile | | No | Not used by Sitka
| Best/Single Match Minimum Quality Ration | | No | Not used by Sitka
| Optional Session Name | NEED INFO | No |
| Remove MARC Field Groups | | No | Not used by Sitka
| Select a Record Source | | Yes |
| Limit Matches to Bucket | | No |
| Import Non-Matching Records | | No |
| Merge On Exact Match (901c) | | No |
| Merge On Single Match | | No |
| Merge On Best Match | | No |
| Auto-overlay In-process Acquisitions Items | | No |
| Auto-overlay On-order Cataloging Items | | No |
| Use Org Unit Matching in Copy to Determine Best Match | | No |
| File to Upload | This is where you select your file of MARC records. | Yes | Co-op Support
recommends loading no more than 500 MARC records in a single file as the importing process
can time out. If you have a file with more than 5000 records, please break it into multiple
files.

Record Match Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

are profiles set up by Sitka to allow for different match points to be used when 
loading records. The default profile is SitkaMatch.  The other profiles are only used 
to load special records. Please contact Co-op Support for which profile to
use if your records require a set of different match points to load.


Merge Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

control how the incoming and existing MARC records are merged. Two profiles have 
been created for all Sitka libraries to use: Merge Using INCOMING Record and 
Merge Using EXISTING Record.

* Merge Using INCOMING Record: all tags in the INCOMING record will be brought into the final record. Tags:
050, 055, 590, 595, 690, 852 and 856 in the ORIGINAL record will be preserved in the final record. The rest will be removed.
* Merge Using EXISTING Record: all tags in the ORIGINAL record will be kept. Tags: 050, 055, 590, 595, 690,
852 and 856 in the INCOMING record will be brought into the final record. The rest will be removed upon merge.
+
These profiles ensure local data in these six fields in a merged MARC record is never 
overwritten, and holding records (in tag 852) can be loaded to either the existing
 MARC record or with the incoming record.

Holdings Import Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

are profiles set up by Sitka to allow importing of item records with vendor 
supplied MARC records. The vendor will need to send item level information 
in a local MARC tag and subfields (eg. 9xx or 852), and this information can 
be mapped into item records when the bibliographic records are loaded. Please 
contact Co-op Support if you are interested in loading item records with your
 bibliographic records.


[TIP]
=====
There are some settings, namely Record Display Attributes, Record Match Sets, 
Merge/Overlay Profiles and Import Item Attributes on this screen that are
 reserved for Sitka server administration. You should not attempt to 
 edit them as they affect all bibliographic records.
