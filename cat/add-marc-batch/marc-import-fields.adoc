Record Match Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

are profiles set up by Sitka to allow for different match points to be used when 
loading records. The default profile is SitkaMatch. It matches on the 901c 
(record id),  020a (ISBN), 022a (ISSN), or 035a (System Control Number). 
It is used in the majority of record loads. The other profiles are only used 
to load special records. Please contact Co-op Support for which profile to
use if your records require a set of different match points to load.


Merge Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

control how the incoming and existing MARC records are merged. Two profiles have 
been created for all Sitka libraries to use: Merge Using INCOMING Record and 
Merge Using EXISTING Record.

* Merge Using INCOMING Record: all tags in the INCOMING record will be brought into the final record. Tags:
050, 055, 590, 595, 690, 852 and 856 in the ORIGINAL record will be preserved in the final record. The rest will be removed.
* Merge Using EXISTING Record: all tags in the ORIGINAL record will be kept. Tags: 050, 055, 590, 595, 690,
852 and 856 in the INCOMING record will be brought into the final record. The rest will be removed upon merge.

These profiles ensure local data in these six fields in a merged MARC record is never 
overwritten, and holding records (in tag 852) can be loaded to either the existing
 MARC record or with the incoming record.

Holdings Import Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

are profiles set up by Sitka to allow importing of item records with vendor 
supplied MARC records. The vendor will need to send item level information 
in a local MARC tag and subfields (eg. 9xx or 852), and this information can 
be mapped into item records when the bibliographic records are loaded. Please 
contact Co-op Support if you are interested in loading item records with your
 bibliographic records.


[TIP]
=====
There are some settings, namely Record Display Attributes, Record Match Sets, 
Merge/Overlay Profiles and Import Item Attributes on this screen that are
 reserved for Sitka server administration. You should not attempt to 
 edit them as they affect all bibliographic records.
