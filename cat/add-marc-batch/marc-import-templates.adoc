Import Templates

Import templates allow you to set up templates with pre-selected values for the MARC Batch
Importer and save them for your workstation.  Templates help to ensure the 
correct fields are entered for different providers while reducing the amount 
of data entry required.

. Go to *Cataloguing-> MARC Batch Import/Export*
. On the _Import_ tab fill in the appropriate fields. See 
xref:_marc_importers[] for information on specific fields.
. In the _Apply/Create Form Template_ field enter a name for your template.
. Click *Save as New Template*.
