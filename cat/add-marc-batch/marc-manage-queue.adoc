Managing Import Queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queues are viewable to the login account only. They will remain on the server until they are deleted. You can delete a queue after importing is finished, or you can keep it and delete it later.

To view a queue, go to *Cataloguing -> MARC Batch Import/Export*. The default screen is Import Records. Click *Inspect Queue* tab to manage and view existing queues used in MARC Batch Import.

Under Inspect Queue you can click on an existing queue to view and import records that have already been queued for importing or simply view records that have already been imported.

To delete queues, select the checkbox in front of the queue name and click *Delete Selected* on the action list.
