Managing Import Queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queues are only viewable to account that created the queue. They will remain on the server until 
they are deleted. You can delete a queue after importing is finished, 
or you can keep it and delete it later.

[TIP]
=====
Please ensure you include screenshots when submitting tickets related to queues to 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].  Co-op Support cannot view 
your queues in the staff client.
