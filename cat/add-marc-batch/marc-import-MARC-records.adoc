Importing MARC Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a MARC record file has been uploaded the records need to be imported into
the catalogue.

Importing Non-Matching Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Records that do not match any existing records in the catalogue are automatically
imported when the MARC file is uploaded if the check box 
_Import Non-Matching Records_ has been checked.
