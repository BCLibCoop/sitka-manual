Label Sheet
^^^^^^^^^^^

If your printer uses sheet labels, you may prepare a template in a text editor. On the above Label Preview screen, copy over labels from Evergreen to your template to print them.


Configuring Label Printing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may configure label prining on *Print Items Label*. There are four tabs on this screen.

*Call Number Template* shows the template used to extract information for the spine label. The default includes call number prefix, copy location prefix, call number label, call number suffix and copy location suffix. 

*Call Numbers* shows the spine label generated for the item based on the above template. For individual spine labels, you may edit them temporarily for the current printing only.

*Settings* is the place where you set up the format of the printing and the label. Settings here will override the group of settings under Item Print Label on Library Settings Editor. 

*Label Template* includes the script used to do the printing job. The top portion is the explanation. The code for printing contents and format starts from *<table ... *.

The default template prints both spine label and pocket label. To print spine label only, you need to delete the portion for printing pocket label.

TIP: If you need to adjust the pocket label content, you may follow the instruction above the printing code. 

CAUTION: Changes made on all tabs, except *Call Numbers* will be automatically saved when you leave the tab. To revert everything back to the default, you may click the *Default* on the top template bar.  

*Label Template*

You may save your adjustment on label printing settings to a label template. For example if you usually print spine labels only, but sometimes print both spine and  pocket label, you may create two templates: one for spine label only, the other both labels. When priting the labels, you just need to choose the appropriate one from the list, then click *Apply*.

To create a label template, make the necessary adjustment on any or all tabs. Once done, you may type in a name in the *Template* box, then click *Save*.
