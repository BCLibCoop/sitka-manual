[TIP]
=====
When exporting, Evergreen will export all templates as one file.  Co-op Support recommends you set up all
templates needed by your cataloguers on one account before exporting the file.

When importing holdings templates, existing templates will be kept and new ones added. Templates sharing 
the same name will be overlaid by the new templates.
