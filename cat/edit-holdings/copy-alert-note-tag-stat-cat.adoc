~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy Alert
^^^^^^^^^^

Copy alert pops up on the screen when the item is retrieved. There are a few types of copy alert that show up when the corresponding type of action is applied to the item. For example, you may add a checkin copy alert when you are checking out an item to a patron and notice that the spine label needs to be replaced. When the item is returned, on checking in, staff will see the message you left. You may create a checkout copy alert for items that have accompanying materials kept separately. When the item is checked out, the alert will pop up on the screen.

Copy alert can be added when you create or edit copy record. Click *Copy Alerts*. Choose a type from the dropdown list. Type in the message, Click *OK*. Back on the copy editor, click *Save & Exit*.
