Copy Alert
^^^^^^^^^^

Copy alert is a field in copy records. The alert message pops up on the screen when the item is retrieved. For example, uou might use a copy alert when you are checking out an item to a patron and notice that the spine label needs to be replaced. When the item is returned, on checking in, staff will see the message you left. You might create a copy alert when you notice that an item has been damaged. When the item is checked in or out, the alert will pop up on the screen.

Copy alert can be added when you create or edit copy record. Type in the message, then click *Save & Exit*.
