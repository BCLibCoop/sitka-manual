Item Alert, Note, Tag and Stat Cat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Item Alert
^^^^^^^^^^

Item alerts pop up on the screen when the item is retrieved. There are a few types of item alert that show up when the corresponding type of action is applied to the item. For example, you may add a checkin item alert when you are checking out an item to a patron and notice that the spine label needs to be replaced. When the item is returned, on checking in, staff will see the message you left. You may create a checkout item alert for items that have accompanying materials kept separately. When the item is checked out, the alert will pop up on the screen.

Item alerts can be added when you create or edit a item record.

. Click *Item Alerts*.
. Choose a type from the dropdown list.
. Type in the message, Click *OK*.
. Back on the item editor, click *Save & Exit*.

Item Statistical Category (Stat Cat)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Item Statistical Category, aka Item Stat Cat, is another piece of item level information that may be added to item records.

. To add a item stat cat, go to item editor.
. In the  *Statistical Categories* column, choose an entry from the appropriate stat cat dropdown list. The value is added when the item record is saved.
