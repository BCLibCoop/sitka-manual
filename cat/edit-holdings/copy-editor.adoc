| Circulate? |Indicates whether the item can circulate or not | Leave it as "YES", unless the item is with a circulating collection (shelving location), but should not be circulated. If the shelving location's Circulate? attribute is "NO", this field will have no effect. But the "NO" value in this field will block circulating when the shelving location's Circulate? is changed to "YES".
