[NOTE]
======
. When the selected items do not share the same value in a field, the field is empty and a dropdown list with the multiple values shows up under the field.
. For each field, you can only put in one value for all the selected records. Do not touch fields that you do not intend to edit, especially those with multiple values.
. You can select a few items to edit, store them in the *Completed Items* tab, then work on other items.
