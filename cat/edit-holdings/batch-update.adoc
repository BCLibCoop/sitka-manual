[NOTE]
======

. When the selected copies do not share the same value in a field, the field is empty on the Copy Editor.
. To update all selected copies to one shared value, for example *Shelving Location*, edit that attribute in Copy Editor in first record.
. You can select a few copies to edit, store them in the *Completed Copies* tab, then work on other copies.
