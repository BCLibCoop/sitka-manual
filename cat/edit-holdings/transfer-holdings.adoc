Transferring Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you need to move copy records from one title record to another, or move copies from one volume to another under the same or another title record. There are a few pairs of functions in Evergreen to allow to do so. The critical step is to ensure that you first mark the destination record, then move the record with the corresponding transfer function. Co-op support recommends you read through the process first before starting, as each scenario has different characteristics.

Transferring Volume and Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you want to transfer all items under one call number/volume to another title or another branch under the same title, you may use Transfer Volume functions. Evergreen will transfer both call number and all copies under it to the new title or branch.

[TIP]
=======
Currently on Holdings View, Evergreen does not display libraries without holdings on the library tree. If your destination library is not shown on the list, you may edit the source volume's owning library and/or its copies' circulation library. Refer to xref:edit-volume-copy-on-holdings-view[] for details.
