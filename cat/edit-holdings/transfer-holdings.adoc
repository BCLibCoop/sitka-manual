Transferring Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you need to move copy records from one title record to another, or move copies from one volume to another under the same or another title record. There are a few pairs of functions in Evergreen to allow you to do so. The critical step is to ensure that you first mark the destination record, then move the record with the corresponding transfer function. Co-op support recommends you read through the process first before starting, as each scenario has different characteristics.

Transferring Volume and Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you want to transfer all items under one call number/volume to another title or another branch under the same title, you may use Transfer Volume functions. Evergreen will transfer both call number and all copies under it to the new title or branch.

[TIP]
=======
Currently on Holdings View, Evergreen does not display libraries without holdings on the library tree. If your destination library is not shown on the list, you may edit the source volume's owning library and/or its copies' circulation library. Refer to xref:edit-volume-copy-on-holdings-view[] for details.

. The source volume record disappeared. The confirmation pops up at the right bottom of the screen.

[TIP]
=====
If the destination library does not have a volume under the destination record, you may transfer the volume under the current library to the destination record first, then edit the owning and circulation library of the volume and copies.
=====

[CAUTION]
=========
The marking destination and transferring source volume functions come in pairs. A destination is kept for each marking destination function. There may be up to four volume transfer destinations marked at one time. The corresponding destination is used when a transferring source volume function is applied. 

The destinations remain marked until new ones are marked or reset (marked via *Mark for* only). Logging out of Evergreen, closing the browser or rebooting your computer will not erase them. Co-op strongly recommends you apply tranfser function right after you marked a destination. 

Choose the apporiate transfer function. Using the wrong one may send your volume to the wrong destination.
