Transferring Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you need to move item records from one title record to another, or move items from one call number to another under the same or another title record. There are functions in Evergreen to allow you to do so. The critical step is to ensure that you first mark the destination record, then move the source record with the corresponding transfer function. Co-op Support recommends you read through the process first before starting, as each scenario has different characteristics.

Transferring Call Numbers and Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you want to transfer all items under one call number to another title record or another library under the same title, you  use the *Transfer Call Number* function. Evergreen will transfer both the call number record and all items under it to the new title and/or library.

[NOTE]
========
Your call number's owning library and items' circulation library will not be changed during the transfer. If you already have call numbers under the destination record and the call numbers are the same, the call numbers will be merged.

If the destination library has a call number with the same call number, the call numbers will be merged during the transfer.

Transferring Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may want to transfer some of the items under one call number to another call number/library under the same or another record, or transfer all items under one call number to another with a different call number. You use the  *Transfer Items* function.

*Transferring Items to Another Call Number/Library*

. Find the destination title record. On *Holdings View*, select the destination call number/library. Click *Actions* dropdown. Go to *Mark* to select *Library/Call Number as Transfer Destination*.
