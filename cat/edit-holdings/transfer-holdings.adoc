Transferring Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you need to move copy records from one title record to another, or move copies from one volume to another under the same or another title record. There are functions in Evergreen to allow you to do so. The critical step is to ensure that you first mark the destination record, then move the source record with the corresponding transfer function. Co-op Support recommends you read through the process first before starting, as each scenario has different characteristics. 

Transferring Volume and Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you want to transfer all items under one call number/volume to another title record or another library under the same title, you  use the *Transfer Volume* function. Evergreen will transfer both the call number record and all items under it to the new title and/or library.

[NOTE]
========
Your volume's owning library and copies' circulation library will not be changed during the transfer. If you already have volumes under the destination record and the call numbers are the same, the call numbers will be merged.

[TIP]

If the destination library has a volume with the same call number as the source volume, the volumes will be merged during the transfer.

Transferring Copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may want to transfer some of the copies under one volume to another volume/library under the same or another record, or transfer all copies under one volume to another with a different call number. You use the  transfer copies function.

*Transferring Copies to Another Volume/Library*

. Find the destination title record. On Holdings View, select the destination volume/library. Click *Actions* dropdown. Go to *Mark* to select *Library/Volume as Transfer Destination*.
