Transferring Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you need to move item records from one title record to another, or move items
from one call number to another under the same or another title record. There are functions in
Evergreen to allow you to do so. The critical step is to ensure that you first mark the destination
record, then move the source record with the corresponding transfer function. Co-op Support recommends
you read through the process first before starting, as each scenario has different characteristics.

library under the same title, you  use the *Transfer Holdings* function. Evergreen will transfer both
the call number record and all items under it to the new title and/or library.
