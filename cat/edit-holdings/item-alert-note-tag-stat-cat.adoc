Item Statistical Category Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Item Statistical Categories, also referred to as item stat cats, can be used to capture item information 
the library needs that isn't otherwise captured in the item record.  This information can be used in reporting.

For information on creating and editing statistical categories see xref:stat-cat[].

The _Stat Cat Filter_ enables you to specify the organizational level at which statistical categories display.
For example, if you have federation wide stat cats as well as library specific ones you can set the filter
to your federation or your library to change what stat cats display.
