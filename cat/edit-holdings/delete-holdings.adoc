Deleting Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When adding items to the catalogue, you need to have a bibliographic record first, then you create a call number and an item record. When you delete holdings you follow the reverse order. You need to delete item records first. By design and Sitka's configuration, Evergreen will also attempt to delete the call number and bibliographic record. These records will be deleted if they are not used by other items/call numbers. If you delete your library's last item, the call number record will be deleted together with the item. If this is also the last item for the title (no other libraries have an item), the bibliographic record will be deleted, too. So, for most cases, you just need to delete the item records. . If possible, Evergreen will delete the call number and bibliographic records automatically. Occasionally you may want to delete an "orphan" call number (without any item) or bibliographic (without any call number) record.

Deleting Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Deleting Items on Item Status Screen*

If you have the item in hand, the quickest way to delete an item is to scan the item into Item Status screen.

. When items are displayed on Item Status screen, select those you want to delete. Click *Actions* dropdown list to select *Delete Items*.

Deleting Call Numbers without Items Attached
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally you may want to delete a call number record without items attached to it. For example, you created a call number record, but did not add an item to it. To delete it, you need to find the title. Go to Holdings View. Highlight the "orphan" call number record, select *Actions -> Delete -> Delete Empty Call Numbers*. If this is the last call number record attached to the bibliographic record, the bibliographic record will be deleted, too.

Deleting Bibliographic Record without Call Number/Item Attached
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may have created/imported a MARC record, but did not use it for your item. In such a scenario you should delete the record. Find the title on the catalogue, go to *MARC Edit*, click *Delete*. You are prompted to confirm the deletion. Once done, the record will be deleted.

If you do not see any itemss under the record, but are prompted that the record can not be deleted, very likely there are "orphan" call number records still under the title. You need to go to Holdings View to locate and delete the call number records. The MARC record will be deleted when you delete the last call number.

[TIP]
=====
Deleted MARC records can be retrieved and undeleted if you know the record's database id. Select *Cataloguing -> Retrieve Title via Database ID*. Type in the record id. Once the record is displayed (with a red coloured background),  go to *MARC Edit*. Click *Undelete*.
