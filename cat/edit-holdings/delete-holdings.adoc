Deleting Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Library staff can delete both regular items and pre-catalogued items from Evergreen.

Items can be deleted via:
* Item Status
* Item Buckets
* the Holdings View tab in a bibliographic record.

[CAUTION]
=========
When deleting items in Evergreen it is important to always check the item's status first. Checked out
items should be checked in to remove them from the patron's account before an item is deleted. 

Deleted items cannot be un-deleted in the staff client.  
=========


Deleting Items via Item Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. In the _Item Status_ interface, scan the items you wish to delete or 
xref:_upload_from_file_choose_file[upload a file] of the barcodes you wish to delete.
. Check the status of the items to ensure none have the status of _Checked Out_.

longer retrievable through the staff client.

Deleting Items via Item Buckets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Retrieve the item bucket that contains the items you wish to delete. For more information on
retrieving and using item buckets see xref:_item_buckets[].
. Check the status of the items to ensure none have the status of _Checked Out_.
+

+
. A pop up will appear asking you to confirm the deletion.  Click *OK/Continue*.

[TIP]
=====
When an item is deleted Evergreen automatically deletes the associated call number record if 
it's not used by any other items so it's not necessary to manually delete call numbers. 
=====
+
. On the pop up that appears click *Delete Holdings*.
+

+
. The item(s) will be deleted. Evergreen will also automatically delete associated call number and 
bibliographic records as necessary.


////
When adding items to the catalogue, you need to have a bibliographic record first, then you create a 
call number and an item record. When you delete holdings you follow the reverse order. You need to 
delete item records first. By design and Sitka's configuration, Evergreen will also attempt to delete 
the call number and bibliographic record. These records will be deleted if they are not used by other 
items/call numbers. If you delete your library's last item, the call number record will be deleted 
together with the item. If this is also the last item for the title (no other libraries have an item), 
the bibliographic record will be deleted, too. So, for most cases, you just need to delete the item records.
 . If possible, Evergreen will delete the call number and bibliographic records automatically. 
 Occasionally you may want to delete an "orphan" call number (without any item) or bibliographic 
 (without any call number) record.

Deleting Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Deleting Items on Item Status Screen*

If you have the item in hand, the quickest way to delete an item is to scan the item into Item Status screen.

. When items are displayed on Item Status screen, select those you want to delete. Click *Actions* dropdown list to select *Delete Items*.
+

+
. You are prompted to confirm deleting the items and call numbers, if any.

[NOTE]
=====
You will see *Item not Found* in a red box showing up after the deletion. You can ignore it.
=====

*Deleting Items on Holdings View*

. Scroll down to *Delete* to select *Delete Items* or *Delete Call Numbers and Items*.

Deleting Call Numbers without Items Attached
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally you may want to delete a call number record without items attached to it. For example, 
you created a call number record, but did not add an item to it. To delete it, you need to find the 
title. Go to Holdings View. Highlight the "orphan" call number record, select *Actions -> Delete -> 
Delete Empty Call Numbers*. If this is the last call number record attached to the bibliographic record, 
the bibliographic record will be deleted, too.

Deleting Bibliographic Record without Call Number/Item Attached
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may have created/imported a MARC record, but did not use it for your item. In such a scenario you should delete the record. Find the title on the catalogue, go to *MARC Edit*, click *Delete*. You are prompted to confirm the deletion. Once done, the record will be deleted.

If you do not see any itemss under the record, but are prompted that the record can not be deleted, very likely there are "orphan" call number records still under the title. You need to go to Holdings View to locate and delete the call number records. The MARC record will be deleted when you delete the last call number.

[TIP]
=====
Deleted MARC records can be retrieved and undeleted if you know the record's database id. Select *Cataloguing -> Retrieve Title via Database ID*. Type in the record id. Once the record is displayed (with a red coloured background),  go to *MARC Edit*. Click *Undelete*.
