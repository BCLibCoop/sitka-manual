Editing Holdings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Evergreen, the call number is kept in a separate record, called volume or call number record. (These two terms are used interchangably in this document.) Items under the same title with the same call number share the same call number record. Copy records and volume records can be edited at several places.

*Edit Volume Copy on Item Status*

. Go to *Circulation  -> Item Status*
