Volume Copy Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Volume Copy templates allow you to set up default values for selected volume and item attributes. For example, all adult fiction items use the same shelving location and circulation modifier. You may set up a template for adult fiction with the appropriate shelving location and circulation modifier values.
