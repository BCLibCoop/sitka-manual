Creating New Records for Non-Bibliographic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some libraries include non-bibliographic items in their collection.  Records created for 
these items aren't required to follow the same standards as records for bibliiographic 
items.

[NOTE]
======
Libraries should create their own records for non-bibliographic records rather than adding their
holdings to an existing record.
======

Co-op Support recommends that records for non-bibliographic resources include the following
fields:

|========
|MARC Field | Name | Required Subfields | Description
