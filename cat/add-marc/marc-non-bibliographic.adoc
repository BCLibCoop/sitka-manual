Creating New Records for Non-Bibliographic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some libraries include non-bibliographic items in their collection.  Records created for 
these items aren't required to follow the same standards as records for bibliiographic 
items.

Co-op Support recommends that records for non-bibliographic resources include the following
fields:

|========
|MARC Field | Name | Required Subfields | Material Type | Description
|https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bdleader.html[Leader] | Leader | N/A | Contains information required for Evergreen to process the record.
|https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd008.html[008] | Fixed-Length Data Elements | N/A  | Contains coding used by Evergreen for search filters and format icons. 
|https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd245.html[245] | Title Statement | $a | Contains the title and author.
|https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd300.html[300] | Physical Description | $a, $c 
($c not required for e-records) | Contains the physical description of the item 
including number of pages and dimensions.
|https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd5xx.html[5XX] | Note Fields | $a | Contains additional 
information about the resource.
|https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd856.html[856] | Electronic Location and Access | 
Contains information for accessing resources related to a physical resource that 
are available electronically.  See 
xref:_related_resources[] for information on how to code this field for a related resource.

[NOTE]

Libraries should create their own records for non-bibliographic records rather than adding their
holdings to an existing record.
