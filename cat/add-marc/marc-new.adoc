Creating New Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is required practice, and http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka cataloguing policy], 
to search Evergreen, Z39.50 sources, or, in some libraries, a vendor file of MARC records, before using a MARC 
record template for original cataloguing. Original cataloguing should be done in Evergreen only 
if there is no record available in any of these previous sources. 

Global MARC Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sitka's Evergreen has global MARC templates for commonly catalogued types of resources with the most frequently used 
fields and subfields included. 


For information about working with MARC records see xref:edit-marc[].

. To access the global MARC templates, go to *Cataloguing -> Create New Marc Record*.

. A blank MARC record will load with the fields and subfields most commonly used for the 
resource type. The Leader and 008 will be coded for the specified type of resource; this coding affect the
format icon and search filters.

. Complete the MARC record as per
 http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka cataloguing policy]. You can add and 
 delete fields and subfields as required.
. Check the box for Add Item if you wish to use the fast item add feature.  You must have 
xref:allow-popups[pop-ups allowed] for this feature to work.

. Click *Save*.
. The record is created and will open up in your tab in the current default view.

[NOTE]
======
If you used *Add Item* the Holdings Editor will have opened in a new tab.

If you did not use *Add Item*, you may now attach holdings as described 
in xref:_adding_holdings_to_bibliographic_records[].

Library Specific MARC Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For some resources, especially non-bibliographic resources, libraries may find they enter the same information
on a regular basis and wish to have it saved in a template.
  
Libraries can create their own MARC templates in two ways.

Template Records within Evergreen
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Template Set Up
. Go to *Cataloguing -> Create New Marc Record*.
. Select the appropriate template and click *Load*.
. Edit the existing template to suit your needs. Make sure you include a title that you can use to retrieve 
your template.
. Click *Save*.
. Create an OPAC invisible fake item attached to the bibliographic record.  This will prevent the record 
from being automatically deleted as part of the routine orphan bib deletion.

Using the Template
. Go to *Cataloguing -> Import Record from Z39.50*.
. Make sure the service *Local Catalogue* is selected.
. Do a title search for your template.
