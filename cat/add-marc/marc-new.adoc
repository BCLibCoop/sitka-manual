Creating New Records for Bibliographic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When cataloguing bibliographic resources it's important to follow 
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka cataloguing policy] to avoid 
creating
duplicate records in the Sitka catalogue. Original cataloguing should be done in Evergreen only 
if there is no record available in the Sitka catalogue, via Z39.50, or from your vendor.

Sitka's Evergreen has global MARC templates for commonly catalogued types of resources with the most frequently 
used fields and subfields included. Libraries can also use a workaround to set 
up xref:_using_library_specific_marc_templates[library specific templates].

. Go to *Cataloguing -> Create New Marc Record*.
. The MARC Template screen opens. Click into the drop down menu to see the available templates.

Once you select a template you can click *Set Workstation Default* to set it as your default
template.

+
. Select the appropriate template and click *Load*.

. A blank MARC record will load with the fields and subfields most commonly used for the 
resource type. The Leader and 008 will be coded for the specified type of resource; this coding 
affects the 
xref:_search_filters_and_format_icons[format icon and search filters].

. Complete the MARC record using the 
xref:_enhanced_marc_editor[Enhanced MARC Editor] or the 
xref:_flat_text_editor[Flat Text Editor] following
 http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka cataloguing policy]. 
. Click *Save*.
. The record is created and will open up in your tab in the current default view.
. xref:add_holdings[Add your holdings] to the record.

[NOTE]
======
If you used *Add Item* the Holdings Editor will have opened in a new tab.

If you did not use *Add Item*, you may now attach holdings as described 
in xref:_adding_holdings_to_bibliographic_records[].
======

////
. Check the box for Add Item if you wish to use the fast item add feature.  You must have 
xref:allow-popups[pop-ups allowed] for this feature to work.
