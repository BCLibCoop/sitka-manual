Creating New Records for Bibliographic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When cataloguing bibliographic resources it's important to follow 
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka cataloguing policy] to avoid 
creating
duplicate records in the Sitka database. Original cataloguing should be done in Evergreen only 
if there is no record available in the Sitka catalogue, via Z39.50, or from your vendor.

Sitka's Evergreen has global MARC templates for commonly catalogued types of resources with the most frequently 
used fields and subfields included. Libraries can also use a workaround to set 
up xref:_using_library_specific_marc_templates[library specific templates].


For information about working with MARC records see xref:edit-marc[].

. To access the global MARC templates, go to *Cataloguing -> Create New Marc Record*.
. The MARC Template screen opens. Click into the drop down menu field to see the available templates. 
Note you can select one and set it as the default template for your workstation here.

. A blank MARC record will load with the fields and subfields most commonly used for the 
resource type. The Leader and 008 will be coded for the specified type of resource; this coding affect the
format icon and search filters.

. Complete the MARC record as per
 http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka cataloguing policy]. You can add and 
 delete fields and subfields as required.
. Check the box for Add Item if you wish to use the fast item add feature.  You must have 
xref:allow-popups[pop-ups allowed] for this feature to work.

. The record is created and will open up in your tab in the current default view.

[NOTE]
======
If you used *Add Item* the Holdings Editor will have opened in a new tab.

If you did not use *Add Item*, you may now attach holdings as described 
in xref:_adding_holdings_to_bibliographic_records[].
