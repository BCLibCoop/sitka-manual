Uploading Cover Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Cover Images)))
(((Cover Art)))

As of version 3.9 Evergreen has an option in the Record Summary to upload cover images.  

Due to capacity limitations this feature is not available to Sitka libraries.

Libraries can host their own images and link to them as a related resource.  See xref:_related_resources[]
for information on how to code the 856 field for related resources.
