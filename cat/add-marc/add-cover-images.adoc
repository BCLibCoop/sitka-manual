Uploading Cover Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Cover Images)))
(((Cover Art)))

As of version 3.9 Evergreen has an option in the Record Summary to upload cover images.  

Due to capacity limitations this feature is not available to Sitka libraries.

Libraries can host their own images and link to them as a related resource.  See xref:_related_resources[]
for information on how to code the 856 field for related resources.

[NOTE]
======
Cover images for bibliographic items in Sitka's Evergreen are supplied by Content Cafe and depend 
on the records having the relevant ISBN (020 field), ISSN (022 field), or UPC (024 field).

Libraries can contact Content Cafe directly to report missing cover images for bibliographic records.  
Please contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if you need Content Cafe's email.

Library staff with appropriate permissions can upload a cover image for a specific bibliographic 
record.  This should be used for adding images to non-bibliographic records or to records for 
highly specialized bibliographic items.

 and include the barcodes for the staff accounts that need access. 

Acceptable file types are jpg, png, xpm, xbm, gif, and bmp. All uploaded images are converted 
to PNG at the time of upload and scaled to small, medium, and large for various uses within the 
public catalogue and staff client.

The scaling algorithm will size images to fit the dimension of each bounding box, while preserving 
aspect ratio. This means that the largest dimension of any image will be scaled to match the 
bounding box. 

* Small = 55px wide x 91px high
* Medium = 120 px wide x 200 px high
* Large = 475px wide x 787 px high

Images associated with a bib record will display in the following locations:

* In the staff catalogue search results list on the left side of the title
* In the staff catalogue bib record details page on the upper left side of the page
* In the public catalogue search results list on the left side of the title
* In the public catalogue record details search page to the left of the title.
