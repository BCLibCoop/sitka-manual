It is good practice and Sitka policy to check the Evergreen database for existing records before importing a record. You may search the catalogue first. Or you can configure the Z39.50 screen to search the Evergreen database as well as Z39.50 targets at once. If searching Evergreen via the Z39.50 screen and you find a record, it is best practice and Sitka policy to then find that record in the catalogue and attach your holdings to it. If you have confirmed that there is no record in Evergreen that matches the item in your hand, but have found a record in another database, simply import the new record into Evergreen and then attach holdings.

. Select single or multiple pre-configured Z39.50 targets from the list. Note that most free targets do not have a User name or Password field. Some free targets and the subscription services held by some Sitka libraries require login. Once you have made your choices, click *Save as Default* to save the services you usually search and the user names and passwords you have entered. They will be automatically selected the next time you open the Z39.50 screen.

. Fill in preferred search criteria and click *Search*. Note that the active search fields will change depending on the targets you select. Different targets may support different search types. For instance, Keyword and Subject will only be active if the local catalogue is selected. When you select multiple targets to search, an active box may apply to only one target.

+
. Search results are displayed in the lower pane. You may hide the top pane to bring up the result list or simply scroll down to it. Information about each retrieved record appears on a separate summary line, with various columns of information.  The *Service* column indicates where the record was found. If "native-evergreen-catalog" is listed in this column, the record is in Evergreen. You may go to next page, if applicable.You may view MARC records, choose to import or overlay MARC records. This example demonstrates importing a record.

. To import a record, choose the record from the results list that you would like to import. You should view the record first by clicking on *View MARC*.  MARC record is displayed in a pop-up window. If a cover image is available, it will display as well. When you are sure you have chosen the correct record to import, click *Import*, if you do not want to edit the record or edit it after importing. The record is imported. A pop-up window shows up with the new record ID and a link to it in the catalogue. You may choose *Go to Record* to add holdings.

[TIP]
====
Sitka has profiled certain fields, primarily 9xx fields, to be automatically stripped when records are imported through Z39.50. The default fields that are stripped are 906, 923, 925, 936, 948, 955, 959, 963. Please contact Co-op support if you would like to see additional fields automatically stripped.

Overlaying Records via Z39.50 Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://goo.gl/kMu9iX[Overlay via Z39.50 (4:23)]

There are times when it is necessary to overlay an existing MARC record in Evergreen with a better MARC record from a Z39.50 target. This lesson will demonstrate the steps required to achieve an overlay. Overlaying a MARC record replaces an existing MARC record and leaves all holdings, and corresponding holds, active circulations, bills, and fines intact. As overlay affects all libraries sharing a MARC record it is critical that this procedure be done judiciously and correctly. Please refer to Sitka's cataloguing policy, Co-op support, or your library's cataloguing mentor, if in place, for more information about this process and its effect on the shared database.


Marking a Record for Overlay
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


You must first identify the MARC record in Evergreen, which you wish to be overlaid. You do this by "marking" it for overlay. The marked-for-overlay effect is temporary for a login session, and only one record at a time can be marked. When you mark another record, the previous record is unmarked. Once a record is marked, it stays marked until it is overlaid, or another record is marked, or you log out of Evergreen. Therefore, you can mark and overlay one record at a time, following through the entire process to completion before moving on to another record.
