Importing Bibliographic Records via Z39.50 Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://youtu.be/SiFEcu8k_2g[*Sitka Training Video - Z39.50 (7:58)*]

It is required practice and Sitka policy to check the Evergreen database for existing records before 
importing a record. You can search the catalogue first, or you can configure the Z39.50 screen to 
search the Evergreen database as well as Z39.50 targets at the same time. If searching Evergreen 
via the Z39.50 screen and you find a record, it is required practice and Sitka policy to find 
that record in the catalogue and attach your holdings to it. If you have confirmed that there 
is no record in Evergreen that matches the item in your hand, but have found a record in another 
database, simply import the new record into Evergreen and then attach holdings.

Searching via Z39.50
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. To access the Z39.50 interface, select *Cataloguing -> Import Record from Z39.50*.
+
. Select the Z39.50 services that you would like to search from the list. 
+
image::images/cat/z3950-search-1.png[]
+
[TIP]
=====
Different types of libraries will see different services listed.

The more services you select the longer your search will take as Evergreen has to search each Z39.50 service. 
Co-op Support recommends setting 3 to 5 sources as your defaults and then adding additional services to 
your searching as needed.
=====
+
. Fill in your search term(s) and click *Search*. 
+
image::images/cat/z3950-search-2.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
The active search fields will change depending on the targets you select. Different targets may support 
different search types. For instance, Keyword and Subject will only be active if the local catalogue is 
selected. When you select multiple targets to search, an active box may apply to only one target.
======
+
. Search results are displayed in the lower pane. You can hide the top pane to bring up the result list 
or simply scroll down to it. 
+
image::images/cat/z3950-search-3.png[]
+
. Information about each retrieved record appears on a separate summary line. The _Service_ column indicates 
where the record was found.
+
image::images/cat/z3950-search-4.png[]
+
. If "native-evergreen-catalog" is listed in the _Service_ column, the record is already in Sitka's database.
Select the record and click *View in Catalogue*.
+
image::images/cat/z3950-search-5.png[]
+
. If the record in the catalogue matches your item xref:_adding_holdings[add your holding], otherwise 
xref:import_from_z3950[import a new record via Z39.50].

. To import a record, view the MARC records for the retruned search results by selecting each record in turn
and clicking *View MARC*.
+

. The MARC record is displayed in a pop-up window. Click *Cancel* to go back to the results list.

. Select the record you have determined in the best match to your item and click *Edit then Import*.
+

+
Make any needed edits to the record.  
+
[NOTE]
======
As the record has not yet been added to the Sitka database and so has no items from other records attached 
you can edit it as needed.  Co-op Support recommends removing any fields that contain local data related 
to items held by the service the record comes from.  In general this information will be found in the 852 
fields and 9xx fields.

The fields 906, 923, 925, 936, 948, 955, 959, and 963 are stripped from imported records by default.
======
+
. Click *Import*.
+
image::images/cat/z3950-import-4.png[]
+
. The record is imported. On the pop-up that appears click *Go to Record*.
. The record will open in a new tab.  You can now add your holding to the record.

Overlaying Records via Z39.50 Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://youtu.be/eMfyQTkmx6g[*Sitka Snippet Video - Overlaying Bibliographic Records via Z39.50 (4:02)*]

There are times when it is necessary to overlay an existing MARC record in Evergreen with a better 
MARC record from a Z39.50 target. Overlaying a MARC record replaces an existing MARC record and leaves 
all holdings, and corresponding holds, active circulations, bills, and fines intact. As overlay affects all 
libraries sharing a MARC record it is critical that this procedure be done judiciously and correctly. 
Please refer to xref:_cataloguing_procedures[Sitka's cataloguing policy] for more information.


Marking a Record for Overlay
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


You must first identify the MARC record which you wish to  overlay. You do this by "marking" it for overlay. Only one record can be marked at a time. When you mark another record, the previous record is unmarked. Once a record is marked, it stays marked until it is overlaid, or has been reset. Therefore, you can mark and overlay one record at a time, following through the entire process to completion before moving on to another record.


. To mark a record for overlay, find it in the catalogue first.
+
. On record details screen, click *Mark for -> Overlay target*.
+

+
. Confirmation appears at the right bottom corner of the screen.
+

[CAUTION]
=========
Overlay target remains even after you log out of Evergreen. After you re-log in, the target is still in effect.
=========


Overlaying Using Z39.50
+++++++++++++++++++++++

. To overlay a record, go to *Cataloguing -> Import Record from Z39.50* to find a target record as described in xref:import_from_z39[]. This record should be a fuller and better catalogued record than the one you are overlaying. You can select potential records on the list based on the summary. Click on *View MARC* to see the full MARC record. Cancel the pop-up window, click on next record to view, or click *Overlay* once deciding on a record to import.
+
image::images/cat/z39-12.png[]
+
. The overlay interface pops up in a new window. The default merge profile is Keep Local Fields, unless you chose another before. You can edit the Z39.50 record before importing it to overlay. Click *Edit Z39.50 Record*.
+
image::images/cat/z39-13.png[]
+
. MARC Edit screen opens up. Edit the record. Once done, click *Save*. You are back on Overlay screen.
+
image::images/cat/z39-14.png[]
+
. Click *Overlay* button at the bottom. The record is imported and displayed in a new tab.


[CAUTION]
=========
You must select *Keep Local Fields* as the merge profile. You may encounter error if you choose others.
