Importing Bibliographic Records via Z39.50 Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://youtu.be/SiFEcu8k_2g[*Sitka Training Video - Z39.50 (7:58)*]

It is required practice and Sitka policy to check the Evergreen database for existing records before
importing a record. You can search the catalogue first, or you can configure the Z39.50 screen to
search the Evergreen database as well as Z39.50 targets at the same time. If searching Evergreen
via the Z39.50 screen and you find a record, it is required practice and Sitka policy to find
that record in the catalogue and attach your holdings to it. If you have confirmed that there
is no record in Evergreen that matches the item in your hand, but have found a record in another
database, simply import the new record into Evergreen and then attach holdings.

Searching via Z39.50
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. To access the Z39.50 interface, select *Cataloguing -> Import Record from Z39.50*.
+
. Select the Z39.50 services that you would like to search from the list.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-search-1.png[]
+
[TIP]
=====
Different types of libraries will see different services listed.

The more services you select the longer your search will take as Evergreen has to search each Z39.50 service.
Co-op Support recommends setting 3 to 5 sources as your defaults and then adding additional services to
your searching as needed.
=====
+
. Fill in your search term(s). 
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-search-2.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
The active search fields will change depending on the targets you select. Different targets may support
different search types. For instance, Keyword and Subject will only be active if the local catalogue is
selected. When you select multiple targets to search, an active box may apply to only one target.
======
+
. Hit *Enter* on your keyboard or click *Submit* (found on the left side of the screen).
. Search results are displayed in the lower pane. You can use the *Hide Form* to button hide the top pane 
or simply scroll down to your results.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-search-3.png[]
+
. Information about each retrieved record appears on a separate summary line.
 The _Source_ column indicates
where the record was found.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-search-4.png[]
+
. If "Local Catalog" is listed in the _Source_ column, the record is already in Sitka's database.
Select the record and click *Show in Catalog*.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-search-5.png[]
+
. If the record in the catalogue matches your item xref:_adding_holdings[add your holding], otherwise
xref:import_from_z3950[import a new record via Z39.50].

. Search for your record via Z39.50. See xref:_searching_via_z39_50[].
. To import a record, view the MARC records for the retruned search results by selecting each record in turn
and clicking *View MARC*.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-import-1.png[]
+
. The MARC record is displayed in a pop-up window. Click *Close* to go back to the results list.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-import-2.png[]
+
. Select the record you have determined in the best match to your item and click *Edit then Import*.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-import-3.png[]
+
. Make any needed edits to the record.
+
[NOTE]
======
As the record has not yet been added to the Sitka database and so has no items from other records attached
you can edit it as needed.  Co-op Support recommends removing any fields that contain local data related
to items held by the service the record comes from.  In general this information will be found in the 852
fields and 9xx fields.

The fields 906, 923, 925, 936, 948, 955, 959, and 963 are stripped from imported records by default.
======
+
. Click *Save Changes* and then click *Import Record*.
+
image::images/cat/z3950/z3950-import-4.png[]
+
. The record is imported. On the pop-up that appears click *Go to Record*.
. The record will open in a new tab.  You can now add your holding to the record.

Overlaying Records via Z39.50 Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://youtu.be/eMfyQTkmx6g[*Sitka Snippet Video - Overlaying Bibliographic Records via Z39.50 (4:02)*]

There are times when it is necessary to overlay an existing MARC record in Evergreen with a better
MARC record from a Z39.50 target. Overlaying a MARC record replaces an existing MARC record and leaves
all holdings, and corresponding holds, active circulations, bills, and fines intact. As overlay affects all
libraries sharing a MARC record it is critical that this procedure be done judiciously and correctly.
Please refer to http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_editing_bibliographic_records.html[Sitka's cataloguing policy] for more information.


Marking a Record for Overlay
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


You must first identify the MARC record which you wish to  overlay. You do this by "marking" it for overlay.
Only one record can be marked at a time. When you mark another record,
the previous record is unmarked. Once a record is marked, it stays marked until it is overlaid,
or has been reset. Therefore, you can mark and overlay one record at a time,
following through the entire process to completion before moving on to another record.

.To mark a record for overlay via the catalogue:
. Retrieve the record in the catalogue.
. On record details screen, click *Mark for -> Overlay Target*.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-2.png[]
+
. Confirmation appears at the right bottom corner of the screen.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-1.png[]

.To mark a record for overlay via the Z39.50 interface.
. In the Z39.50 interface xref:_searching_via_z39_50[search for your title].
. Select the result for _Local Catalog_ and click *Mark for Overlay*.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-3.png[]
+
. The record ID of the record to be overlaid will display on the right.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-4.png[]


[CAUTION]
=========
The overlay target will remain even after you log out of Evergreen. After you re-log in, the target is
still in effect.
=========


Overlaying Using Z39.50
+++++++++++++++++++++++

. Search for your record via Z39.50. See xref:_searching_via_z39_50[].
. Select the record you would like to overlay over the existing record and click *Overlay*.
+
[CAUTION]
=========
The record you overlay over the existing record should be a fuller and better record than the one it's
replacing, but still describe the same title. Any changes you make when overlaying records affect all
Sitka libraries with holdings attached to the record.
=========
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-5.png[]
+
. The overlay interface opens in a pop up. You must choose _Keep Local Fields_ as your merge profile. This will
 copy any 050, 055, 092, 590, 595, 690, 852, and 856 fields from the existing record into the new one you
are bringing in.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-6.png[]
+
. Click *Edit Z39.50 Record*.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-7.png[]
+
. Make any needed edits to the record following
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_editing_bibliographic_records.html[Sitka's cataloguing policy]
and click *Save Changes*.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-8.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
As the record already exists in the Sitka database and has holdings for other libraries only make edits
that conform with Sitka's cataloguing policy. Co-op Support does recommend removing any fields that contain
local data related to items held by the service the record comes from.  In general this information will
be found in the 852 fields and 9xx fields.

The fields 906, 923, 925, 936, 948, 955, 959, and 963 are stripped from imported records by default.
======
+
. Click *Merge and Overlay*.
+
image:images/cat/z3950/z3950-overlay-9.png[]
+
. The record is imported and overlaid over the existing record which opens in a new tab.


[CAUTION]
=========
You must select *Keep Local Fields* as the merge profile. You may encounter an error if you choose another.
