Using Library Specific MARC Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the global MARC templates Co-op Support has come up with a couple ways that libraries can 
create their own MARC templates which can be copied and edited.  

This is useful if you are entering the same information on a regular basis when creating new records, such as with 
non-bibliographic records.

Template Set Up
+++++++++++++++

. Go to *Cataloguing -> Create New Marc Record*.
. Select the appropriate template and click *Load*.
. Edit the existing template to suit your needs. Make sure you include a title that you can use to retrieve 
your template.
. Click *Save*.
. Create an OPAC invisible fake item attached to the bibliographic record.  This will prevent the record 
from being automatically deleted as part of the routine orphan bib deletion.

Using the Template

. Make sure the service *Local Catalogue* is selected.
. Do a title search for your template.
. Select the template record and click *Edit then Import*.
. Complete the MARC record as per
 http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_cataloguing_policy.html[Sitka cataloguing policy]. You can add and 
 delete fields and subfields as required.
