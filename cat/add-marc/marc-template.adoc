Using Library Specific MARC Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the global MARC templates Co-op Support has come up with a couple ways that libraries can 
create their own MARC templates which can be copied and edited.  

This is useful if you are entering the same information on a regular basis when creating new records, such as with 
non-bibliographic records.  You can also include hints for staff about what should go in particular fields but
you'll want to make sure staff know to delete those hints before saving the new record.

. Add a fake OPAC invisible item to the bibliographic record.  This will prevent the record 
from being automatically deleted as part of the routine orphan bib deletion.

[NOTE]
======
For your fake items Co-op Support recommends:

* Set up a shelving location that is OPAC invisible, not holdable, and not circulatable. 
* Use the Status _Cataloging_.
* Use real barcodes from your range or use the format LIBRARYCODEtemplateNUMBER to ensure there is no conflict
with other barcodes in the Sitka.
