Creating New Records for Electronic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bibliographic records can be used to include electronic resources in the catalogue.
Electronic resources include e-books, e-audiobooks, e-magazines, e-videos, 
websites, online journals, etc.

Bibliographic records for electronic resources in Evergreen use the 856 field for 
their holdings.  Records for electronic resources will only dispay in your public
catalogue if the 856 field has been formatted correctly and includes a $9 with
your library code or the code for an ancestor of your library.


[NOTE]
=====
These instructions are for adding individual records. To upload a batch of records 
(e.g. from an e-book subscription), please contact Co-op Support.  Information related to batch loading e-records can be found in the section  
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_batch_loading_bibliographic_records.html[Batch Loading Bibliographic Records] in Sitka's
Evergreen Policy & Best Practices Manual.
=====

. Search the catalogue for a record that matches the electronic resource, as described
in xref:_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes[]. If a matching record 
is not found 
xref:_importing_bibliographic_records_via_z39_50_interface[import a record via 
Z39.50] or xref:_creating_new_records_for_bibliographic_resources[create a new 
MARC record].
.. A record for a physical edition of the resource is NOT a match.
. Click the title link to open the record.

. Click *MARC Edit*.

. Add an 856 tag to the MARC record using the Enhanced MARC Editor
or the Flat Text Editor.
.. You must set the first indicator to 4 and the second indicator 
to 0 or 1. The indicators cannot be left blank.
.. Add applicable subfields from the table below.

| Subfield code | Description | Example | OPAC Display
| $u | Required; the URL or link to the resource | http://www.linktoresource.ca | Appears as a link in the OPAC display; the link text is the URI unless subfield $y is specified
| $y | Recommended; a display label for the link | Click for access | 	Appears as the text of the link instead of the URL defined in $u
| $z | Optional; a public note providing more information about the resource | library card required | Appears in parentheses to the right of the link
| $9 | Required; your library code | MPL | 	Not displayed in the OPAC but required for the record to be included in searches scoped to your library

. After the 856 tag is added, the record will be displayed as search result in the public catalogue for the 
for the library specified in the $9. The images below shows a sample 856 tag and the corresponding 
public catalogue display.

[TIP]
=====
A separate 856 tag should be added for each library that catalogues the resource. Multi-branch 
libraries may add a single 856 tag using the code for the library system (e.g. SCRL, BCREK) if 
all branches are allowed to access the resource.

Evergreen creates an invisible call number for each 856 tag with subfield 9 with the code in 
subfield 9 as the owning library. This call number, like a copy record, is used for scoping the 
seach result to a selected library.

To remove an electronic record from your library's collection, you need to delete your library's 856 tag. 
If your library's 856 tag is the only one, you may delete the MARC record. See Deleting MARC records 
for more information.

Related Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Related resources can be resources such as table of contents or custom cover art.  These can be linked 
to the main resource using a 856 tag.

To link a related resource:

. Locate, import, or create a bibliographic record as described in the preceding chapters.
. Click the title link to go to record details. Click *MARC Edit*.
. Add an 856 tag to the MARC record. Place the cursor in the desired location and press 
CTRL+Enter to add an empty row. Enter the tag number (856). You must set the first indicator to 4, 
and the second indicator to 2. The indicators cannot be left blank. For information about indicators 
see http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd856.html.
. Add applicable subfields from the table below.

| Subfield code | Description | Example | OPAC Display
| $u | Required; the URL or link to the related resource | http://www.linktoresource.ca | Appears as a link in the OPAC display; the link text is the URI unless subfield $y is specified
| $y | Recommended; a display label for the link | Click for access | 	Appears as the text of the link instead of the URL defined in $u
| $3 | Optional; a description of what the related resource is | Related Resource | Appears as text beside the link or display label.
| $9 | Required; your library code | MPL | 	Not displayed in the OPAC but required for the related resource to display.

[NOTE]
======
If an 856 tag has both a $3 and a $z neither will display in the public catalogue.  We recommend always using $y
instead of $z.

. After the 856 tag is added, the link will display when the record is viewed in your public catalogue. The 
image below shows a sample 856 tag and the corresponding public catalogue display.
