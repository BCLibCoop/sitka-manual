Creating New Records for Electronic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bibliographic records can be used to include electronic resources in the catalogue.
Electronic resources include e-books, e-audiobooks, e-magazines, e-videos, 
websites, online journals, etc.

Bibliographic records for electronic resources in Evergreen use the 856 field for 
their holdings.  Records for electronic resources will only dispay in your public
catalogue if the 856 field has been formatted correctly and includes a $9 with
your library code or the code for an ancestor of your library.


[NOTE]
=====
These instructions are for adding individual records. To upload a batch of records 
(e.g. from an e-book subscription), please contact Co-op Support.  Information related to batch loading e-records can be found in the section  
http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_batch_loading_bibliographic_records.html[Batch Loading Bibliographic Records] in Sitka's
Evergreen Policy & Best Practices Manual.

. Search the catalogue for a record that matches the electronic resource, as described
in xref:_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes[]. If a matching record 
is not found 
xref:_importing_bibliographic_records_via_z39_50_interface[import a record via 
Z39.50] or xref:_creating_new_records_for_bibliographic_resources[create a new 
MARC record].
.. A record for a physical edition of the resource is NOT a match.
. Click the title link to open the record.

. Click *MARC Edit*.

+
. Add an 856 field to the MARC record using the Enhanced MARC Editor
or the Flat Text Editor.
.. You must set the first indicator to 4 and the second indicator 
to 0 or 1. The indicators cannot be left blank.
.. Add applicable subfields from the table below.

[options="header"]
|===
| Subfield code | Description | Example | OPAC Display
| $u | Required; the URL or link to the resource | http://www.linktoresource.ca | Appears as a link in the OPAC display; the link text is the URI unless subfield $y is specified
| $y | Recommended; a display label for the link | Click for access | 	Appears as the text of the link instead of the URL defined in $u
| $z | Optional; a public note providing more information about the resource | library card required | Appears in parentheses to the right of the link
| $9 | Required; your library code | MPL | 	Not displayed in the OPAC but required for the record to be included in searches scoped to your library

856 - Electronic Location and Access] for more information.

. Once the 856 field is added the record will be displayed as search 
result in the public catalogue for the library specified in the $9.

. If desired, a custom image can be uploaded for bibliographic records for highly 
specialized titles.  See 
xref:_uploading_cover_images[].

[TIP]
=====
A separate 856 tag should be added for each library that catalogues the resource. Multi-branch 
libraries may add a single 856 field using the code for the library system (e.g. SCRL, BCREK) if 
all branches are allowed to access the resource.

Evergreen creates an invisible call number for each 856 tag with subfield 9 with the code in 
subfield 9 as the owning library. This call number, like a copy record, is used for scoping the 
seach result to a selected library.

To remove an electronic record from your library's collection, you need to delete 
the 856 field with a $9 with your library code.  See xref:_deleting_holdings_for_electronic_resources[].

Related Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MARC records for bibliographic (physical and electronic) and non-bibliographic titles 
can include additional links to related resources such as table of contents, excerpts, and 
finding aids.  

.To add a link for a related resource:
. Search the catalogue for a record that matches the electronic resource, as described
in xref:_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes[]. If a matching record 
is not found 
xref:_importing_bibliographic_records_via_z39_50_interface[import a record via 
Z39.50] or xref:_creating_new_records_for_bibliographic_resources[create a new 
MARC record].
.. A record for a physical edition of the resource is NOT a match.
. Click the title link to open the record.

.. You must set the first indicator to 4 and the second indicator 
to 2. The indicators cannot be left blank.
.. Add applicable subfields from the table below.

| $y | Recommended; a display label for the link | Click for access | 	Appears as the text of the link instead of the URL defined in $u
| $3 | Optional; a description of what the related resource is | Related Resource | Appears as text beside the link or display label.
| $9 | Required; your library code | MPL | 	Not displayed in the OPAC but required for the related resource to display.

[CAUTION]
=========
If an 856 field has both a $3 and a $z neither will display in the public catalogue.  We recommend always using $y
instead of $z.
=========
+ 
. After the 856 field is added, the link will display when the record is viewed 
in your public catalogue.
