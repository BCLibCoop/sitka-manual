Cataloguing Non-physical Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ordinary bibliographic records are only visible in the OPAC when holdings records are attached, but it is 
also possible to catalogue non-physical resources such as websites, online journals, or downloadable 
audiobooks, etc. by adding a 856 tag with subfield $9. The steps below describe how to catalogue a 
non-physical resource so it appears in OPAC searches.

[NOTE]
=====
These instructions are for adding individual records. To upload a batch of records 
(e.g. from an e-book subscription), please contact Co-op Support. For libraries that subscribe to 
OverDrive, Co-op Support creates and updates bibliographic records automatically.
=====

. Locate, import, or create a bibliographic record as described in the preceding chapters.
. Click the title link to go to record details. Click *MARC Edit*.
. Add an 856 tag to the MARC record. Place the cursor in the desired location and press CTRL+Enter to add an empty row. Enter the tag number (856). You must set the first indicator to 4, and the second indicator to 0 or 1. The indicators cannot be left blank. For information about indicators see http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd856.html.
. Add applicable subfields from the table below.

|===
| Subfield code | Description | Example | OPAC Display
| $u | Required; the URL or link to the resource | http://www.linktoresource.ca | Appears as a link in the OPAC display; the link text is the URI unless subfield $y is specified
| $y | Recommended; a display label for the link | Click for access | 	Appears as the text of the link instead of the URL defined in $u
| $z | Optional; a public note providing more information about the resource | library card required | Appears in parentheses to the right of the link
| $9 | Required; your library code | BBI | 	Not displayed in the OPAC but required for the record to be included in searches scoped to your library
|===
. After the 856 tag is added, the record will be displayed as search result on OPAC for the library in $9. The image below shows a sample 856 tag and the corresponding OPAC display. This record would appear in OPAC searches of the Bowen Island Public Library catalogue (BBI).

[TIP]
=====
A separate 856 tag should be added for each library that catalogues the resource. Multi-branch 
libraries may add a single 856 tag using the code for the library system (e.g. SCRL, BCREK) if 
all branches are allowed to access the resource.

Evergreen creates an invisible call number for each 856 tag with subfield 9 with the code in 
subfield 9 as the owning library. This call number, like a copy record, is used for scoping the 
seach result to a selected library.

To remove a non-physical record from your library's collection, you need to delete your library's 856 tag. 
If your library's 856 tag is the only one, you may delete the MARC record. See Deleting MARC records 
for more information.

Related Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Related resources can be resources such as table of contents or custom cover art.  These can be linked 
to the main resource using a 856 tag.

To link a related resource:

. Locate, import, or create a bibliographic record as described in the preceding chapters.
. Click the title link to go to record details. Click *MARC Edit*.
. Add an 856 tag to the MARC record. Place the cursor in the desired location and press 
CTRL+Enter to add an empty row. Enter the tag number (856). You must set the first indicator to 4, 
and the second indicator to 2. The indicators cannot be left blank. For information about indicators 
see http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd856.html.
. Add applicable subfields from the table below.

| Subfield code | Description | Example | OPAC Display
| $u | Required; the URL or link to the related resource | http://www.linktoresource.ca | Appears as a link in the OPAC display; the link text is the URI unless subfield $y is specified
| $y | Recommended; a display label for the link | Click for access | 	Appears as the text of the link instead of the URL defined in $u
| $3 | Optional; a description of what the related resource is | Cover Art | Appears as text beside the link or display label.
| $9 | Required; your library code | ZSP-A | 	Not displayed in the OPAC but required for the related resource to display.

[NOTE]
======
If an 856 tage has both a $3 and a $z neither will display in the public catalogue.  We recommend always using $y
instead of $z.

. After the 856 tag is added, the link will display when the record is viewed in your public catalogue. The 
image below shows a sample 856 tag and the corresponding public catalogue display.
