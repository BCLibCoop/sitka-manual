It is critical to search the database before adding titles, volumes, or copies. Good practice is to assume 
the item you are adding already exists, and to do an exhaustive search for the item before cataloguing it. By 
doing so, you will discover whether you need to add your item to an existing title record, or if you need 
to import or create a new title record. It is very important that you scope your cataloguing searches to the 
entire Sitka database.  In the Catalogue Preferences you set Sitka as your Default Search Library.
