Billing a Patron

(((Bills, Add Bills)))
(((Bill Patron)))


There are two categories of bills in Evergreen:

*System Generated Bills*

Bills created by Evergreen show a type of _circulation_.  Evergreen will generate bills when 
items are marked as lost or damaged and include any set processing fees.  Additionally, once an 
item is overdue, Evergreen will generate on-going overdue fines based on a library's circulation policies; 
overdue fines are generated overnight.

*Staff Generated Bills*

Bills created manually by staff show a type of _grocery_.  Sitka libraries share a list of billing types
which staff can choose from.

Additional library specific bill types can be added by https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] 
if a library requires a unique bill type; default prices can be attached to the unique bill type.
