Voiding Bills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Void Bills)))

Local system administrators can void bills, either entirely or in part. 

Voiding a Bill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an entire bill is voided there is no record of the bill or that is was voided. Co-op Support 
recommends you use the xref:_adjusting_the_bill_balance_to_zero[adjust to zero] function instead of 
voiding entire bills.

. In the patron's account click on the *Bills* tab.
. Select the bill line you wish to void and click *Actions -> Void All Billings*.
