Adjusting the Bill Balance to Zero
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Adjust to Zero)))

This function sets any balance to zero and can be used to clear bills that you have determined the patron
should not pay, possibly because they shouldn't have been billed in the first place.  A record of the 
adjustment is kept in the patron's transaction xref:_bill_history[history].

For bills that the patron should have been billed but that staff are choosing to forgive Co-op Support
recommends using the _Forgive_ payment instead to enable staff to track amounts that are forgiven.  See
xref:_making_payments[].

Adjust to zero can also be used to clear a negative balance from patron account.  If money is being returned
to the patron staff should instead xref:_refunding_payments[refund the payment].

. In the patron's account click on the *Bills* tab.
. Select the bill line item and click *Actions -> Adjust to Zero*.
