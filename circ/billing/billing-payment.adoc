Making Payments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Bills Payment)))
(((Pay Bills)))

Bills can be paid by cash, check, or credit, or be resolved by forgiveness, work, or goods.

If the patron should not have to pay the bill (ie. the patron should not have been billed in the 
first place) see xref:_adjusting_the_bill_balance_to_zero[] and xref:_voiding_bills[] for additional options
to resolve the bill.

. In the patron's account click on the *Bills* tab.
. Select or de-select bills to pay. Oldest bills are paid first by default.
. If the patron would like a printed receipt check the box for *Receipt On Payment* and enter the number of 
copies to print in the *# Items* field.

the box for *Convert Change to Patron Credit*.
