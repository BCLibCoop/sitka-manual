Refunding Payments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Refund)))

If a paid bill is voided, either by staff or by the system, it may result in a negative balance on the patron's
account.  To close negative bills, you can link:_adjusting_the_bill_balance_to_zero[adjust the balance to 
zero], link:_add_charge_to_existing_bill[add a bill entry to the negative line item], 
or refund the balance amount.

On occasion staff may need to manually void a payment in order to trigger the refund.  See 
xref:_voiding_a_paid_bill[].

[NOTE]
======
The most common scenario resulting in a negative balance is a lost item that has been paid for being 
returned within the library's refund interval.  See LINK for information on lost settings.
