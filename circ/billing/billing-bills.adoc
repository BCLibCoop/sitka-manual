Circulation vs. Grocery Bills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Bills)))

There are two types of bills in Sitka's Evergreen: *Circulation* bills and *Grocery* bills.

* Circulation bills are system-generated charges such as overdue fines, lost item costs, and processing fees. The fine rates, replacement costs, and 
processing fees are determined by each library.

* Grocery bills are manually created by staff. Sitka libraries share a list of default bill types.  Additional library specific bill types
can be added by https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if a library requires a unique bill type; default prices can be attached to the unique bill type.
