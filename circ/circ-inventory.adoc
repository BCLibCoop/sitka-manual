Inventory
----------
(((Inventory)))
(((Update Inventory Date)))
(((Checkin Modifier)))
(((Item Status)))
(((Holdings View)))

[NOTE]
======
The following guidelines and workflows have been developed by Co-op Support based on 
the functionality available in Sitka's Evergreen and the experience of inventory 
projects done by libraries in the Sitka consortium and the Evergreen community.
======

Item records include fields for inventory date and inventory workstation. The
values in these fields are updated when an item in inventoried by using the
*Update Inventory* action in _Item Status_ or the *Update Inventory* checkin 
modifier at _Check In_.

The inventory date and workstation can be seen in several places in the staff
client:

* Item Status - List View

* Bibliographic Record - Holdings View

[NOTE]
======
Due to a bug the inventory workstation in the Holdings View currently displays
the workstation database ID rather than the workstation name.
