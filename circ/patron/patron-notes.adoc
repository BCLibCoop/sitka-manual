Patron Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Patron Messages)))
(((Patron Alerts)))

There are three types of patron notes in Evergreen:

* Note - information recorded on the patron account.
* Alert - information recorded on the patron account that generates an alert when the patron's account
is retrieved.
* Block - information recorded on the patron account that blocks patrons from checking out, renewing, 
and placing items on hold.

Notes, alerts, and blocks can be applied to a patron's account automatically by the system 
or manually by staff.  These can be viewed and managed on the _Notes_ tab in the patron account.

When a patron has an alert or a block on their account a red *Stop* sign is displayed when the account 
is retrieved.

Evergreen will automatically apply alerts in the following situations:

* patron's account has expired.
* patron has a hold ready for pick up.
* patron has an invalid email address.
* patron has an invalid phone number.
* patron has an invalid address.

Evergreen will automatically apply blocks in the following situations:

* patron exceeds fine threshold.
* patron exceeds max overdue threshold.
* patron exceeds max checked out item threshold.
* patron exceeds max lost item threshold.

When these blocks are applied to an account the patron is blocked from checking out, renewing, and placing items on hold.
Evergreen will also not capture or fulfill holds for the patron.  The max checked out item threshold is an
exception; patrons with this block can still renew and place holds on items.

The thresholds for these blocks are set per library and can be edited by a local system 
administrator in xref:_group_penalty_thresholds[Group Penalty Thresholds].

Evergreen will remove these blocks and alerts when the cause is resolved.

Blocks can also be overridden by staff with appropriate permissions when 
xref:_holds_status_messages[placing holds], xref:_exceptions_at_check_out[checking out items], 
or xref:_exceptions_at_renewal[renewing items].
