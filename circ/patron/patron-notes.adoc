Patron Notes

(((Patron Messages)))
(((Patron Alerts)))

Alerts, notes, and blocks are applied to a patron's account either automatically by the system or manually
by staff.

System Generated Alerts and Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a patron has an alert or a block on their account a red *Stop* sign is displayed when the account 
is retrieved.

Evergreen will automatically apply alerts in the following situations:

* patron's account has expired.
* patron has a hold ready for pick up.
* patron has an invalid email address.
* patron has an invalid phone number.
* patron has an invalid address.

Evergreen will automatically apply blocks in the following situations:

* patron exceeds fine threshold.
* patron exceeds max overdue threshold.
* patron exceeds max checked out item threshold.
* patron exceeds max lost item threshold.

When these blocks are applied to an account the patron is blocked from checking out, renewing, and placing items on hold.
Evergreen will also not capture or fulfill holds for the patron.  The max checked out item threshold is an
exception; patrons with this block can still renew items, place holds on items, and have holds captured
for them.

The thresholds for these blocks are set per library and can be edited by a local system 
administrator in xref:_group_penalty_thresholds[Group Penalty Thresholds].

Evergreen will remove these blocks and alerts when the cause is resolved.

These blocks can also be overridden on an item by item basis. Alternatively, you can remove the 
block temporarily to carry out the circulation actions that need to be overridden. If the conditions 
persist, once you refresh or re-access the patron account the block will be re-applied immediately.
