Patron Self-Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron Self-Registration allows patrons to initiate registration for a library account through the 
public catalogue.  Patrons can fill out a web-based form with basic information that 
will be stored as a “pending patron” in Evergreen.  Library staff can review pending patrons 
in the staff-client and use the pre-loaded account information to create a full patron account.  
Pending patron accounts that are not approved within a configurable amount of time will be 
automatically deleted.

to trigger Evergreen to check for duplicate patrons.

. You also have the option to delete pending patron accounts if the account is determined to be duplicate or no 
longer needed.  Select the pending patrons you wish to delete and click the *Delete Pending Patron(s)* button.

Library Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three library settings manage patron self-registration.  Please contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support]
 to enable patron self-registration and include in your email the values you'd like for the expire interval 
 and dislay timeout.

* *OPAC: Allow Patron Self-Registration* must be set to ‘True’ to enable use of this feature.

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Expire Interval* to set the amount of time after which pending patron accounts 
should be deleted.

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Display Timeout* to set the amount of time after which the patron self-registration 
screen will timeout in the OPAC.  The default is 5 minutes.

The patron self-registration form shares settings with the staff client registration form.  
See xref:_customizing_the_display_fields[] for information on customizing which fields display and which fields
are required.
