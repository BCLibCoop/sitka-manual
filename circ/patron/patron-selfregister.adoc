Patron Self-Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron Self-Registration allows patrons to initiate registration for a library account through the OPAC.  Patrons can fill out a web-based form with basic information that will be stored as a “pending patron” in Evergreen.  Library staff can review pending patrons in the staff-client and use the pre-loaded account information to create a full patron account.  Pending patron accounts that are not approved within a configurable amount of time will be automatically deleted.

*Patron Self-Registration*

. In the OPAC, click on the link to *Request Library Card*

. Fill out the self-registration form to request a library card, and click *Submit Registration*.

*Library Settings*

Three new Library Settings have been created to manage patron self-registration:

* *OPAC: Allow Patron Self-Registration* must be set to ‘True’ to enable use of this feature. *Only Co-op Support can edit this setting. Contact Co-op Support if you would like to enable Patron Self-Registration*

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Expire Interval* allows each library to set the amount of time after which pending patron accounts should be deleted.

* *OPAC: Patron Self-Reg. Display Timeout* allows each library to set the amount of time after which the patron self-registration screen will timeout in the OPAC.  The default is 5 minutes.

Several existing Library Settings can be used to determine if a field should be required or hidden in the self-registration form:

* *GUI: Require day_phone field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show day_phone on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require dob (date of birth) field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Require State field on patron registration*

* *GUI: Show State field on patron registration*

Several existing Library Settings can be used to verify values in certain fields and provide examples for data format on the registration form:

* *Global: Patron username format*

* *GUI: Regex for phone fields on patron registration* OR *GUI: Regex for day_phone field on patron registration*
