Fields in the Patron Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The patron account is made up of required and non-required fields, some of which are filled out based on
local library policy and some of which are determined by global Sitka policy.

Viewing a Patron Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The patron form can display Required Fields, Suggested Fields, or All Fields. 

The fields 






NOTE: The patron account record is composed of required and optional fields, and some fields 
are editable by your patrons via the *My Account* feature on your online catalogue. It is good 
practice to familiarize your self with the basic functions and features of the patron record as 
described below.


* All fields highlighted in yellow are mandatory.

* Blank mandatory fields and fields with a value in the wrong format will result in a "Form is invalid" error.

* *Primary Name* and *Preferred Name* enables greater flexibility, and is optional. Click on tab to switch between fields.

* *Juvenile flag*. This flag is optional. Each library can determine an age threshold of juvenile patrons. The checkbox must be manually de-selected, there is no automated process to update the record.

* *Receive Overdue and Courtesy Emails* checkbox allows patrons to opt-in or opt-out of receiving courtesy and overdue email notifications. Patrons can also set this in *My Account* on your online catalogue.


* *Main (Profile) Permission Group*. Sitka's Evergreen has a shared list of patron profile groups, but individual libraries choose which profiles to use, and how to configure chosen profiles to suit local policy.

* *Privilege Expiration Date*. There is a Sitka default of 3 years for all profile groups except PL New User, which has an expiration of 3 months. The expiry date can be edited on all profile groups.

* *Is Group Lead Account* should always be unchecked.

* Statistical categories are used to further group patrons by categories not in the profile groups. Individual libraries can create their own patron statistical categories.

* *Save and Clone* will save the patron record and open a new patron record. Phone numbers will be copied into the new record. Depending on your library's setting, addresses may also be linked from original record, and can only be edited in original patron record.
