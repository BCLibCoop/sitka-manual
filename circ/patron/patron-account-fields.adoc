*Statistical Categories*

Patron statistical categories are used to further group patrons by categories not otherwise captured
in the patron account fields. Whether statistical
categories are required or not depends on how they are set up.  For information on setting up patron
statistical categories see xref:_statistical_category_editor[].


Customizing the Display Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The patron form can display Required Fields, Suggested Fields, or All Fields. 

image:images/circ/patron-fields-1.png[]

By default all fields will display.  The local system administrator at your library can set the default to 
_Suggested Fields_ using the library setting _Default showing suggested patron registration fields_.

Customizing the fields that display and are required in the patron account can help ensure the relevant information
is being recorded for your patrons and can cut down on unnessary information being saved.

Required Fields
+++++++++++++++

There are a number of fields that are required for all patron accounts across Sitka, such as barcode, home library
 and permission group.  Required fields that must be filled in to save the account are indicated in yellow.
 
Libraries can decide to set additional fields as required to conform with local policy.
The applicable library settings are:

* Require State field on patron registration
* Require at least one address for Patron Registration
* Require day_phone field on patron registration
* Require dob field on patron registration
* Require email field on patron registration
* Require evening_phone field on patron registration
* Require other_phone field on patron registration
* Require prefix field on patron registration
* require ident_value field on patron registration

When the setting is set to True the field will be indicated as required in yellow and will display when
*Required Fields* is selected.

Additionally, setting any of the library settings that begin with _Show_ to True will cause the applicable
field to display when *Required Fields* is selected, though the field does not have to be filled in to save
the account.

The _Email Address_, _Default Phone Number_, and _Default SMS/Text Number_ fields are always required when
the equivalent check box is checked for _Hold Notices_. Unchecking the relevant box will stop the 
field from being required.

field to display when *Suggested Fields* is selected.
