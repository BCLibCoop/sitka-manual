Fields in the Patron Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The patron account is made up of required and optional fields, some of which are filled out based on
local library policy and some of which are determined by global Sitka policy. Some fields can be edited by
patrons via _My Account_.


Viewing a Patron Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The patron form can display Required Fields, Suggested Fields, or All Fields.

By default all fields will display.  The local system administrator at your library can set the default to 
_Suggested Fields_ using the library setting _Default showing suggested patron registration fields_.

Customizing the fields that display and are required in the patron account can help ensure the relevant information
is being recorded for your patrons and can cut down on unnessary information being saved.

Required Fields

There are a number of fields that are required for all patron accounts across Sitka, such as barcode, home library
 and permission group.  Required fields that must be filled in to save the account are indicated in yellow.
 
 Libraries can decide to set additional fields as required to conform with local policy.
The applicable library settings are:

* Require State field on patron registration
* Require at least one address for Patron Registration
* Require day_phone field on patron registration
* Require dob field on patron registration
* Require email field on patron registration
* Require evening_phone field on patron registration
* Require other_phone field on patron registration
* Require prefix field on patron registration
* require ident_value field on patron registration

When the setting is set to True the field will be indicated as required in yellow and will display when
*Required Fields* is selected.

Additionally, setting any of the library settings that begin with _Show_ to True will cause the applicable
field to display when *Required Fields* is selected, though the field does not have to be filled in to save
the account.

The _Email Address_, _Default Phone Number_, and _Default SMS/Text Number_ fields are always required when
the equivalent check box is checked for _Hold Notices_. Unchecking the relevant box will stop the 
field from being required.

Suggested Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting any of the library settings that begin with _Suggest_ to True will cause the applicable
field to display when *Suggested Fields* is selected.









* All fields highlighted in yellow are mandatory.

* Blank mandatory fields and fields with a value in the wrong format will result in a "Form is invalid" error.

* *Primary Name* and *Preferred Name* enables greater flexibility, and is optional. Click on tab to switch between fields.

* *Juvenile flag*. This flag is optional. Each library can determine an age threshold of juvenile patrons. The checkbox must be manually de-selected, there is no automated process to update the record.

* *Receive Overdue and Courtesy Emails* checkbox allows patrons to opt-in or opt-out of receiving courtesy and overdue email notifications. Patrons can also set this in *My Account* on your online catalogue.


* *Main (Profile) Permission Group*. Sitka's Evergreen has a shared list of patron profile groups, but individual libraries choose which profiles to use, and how to configure chosen profiles to suit local policy.

* *Privilege Expiration Date*. There is a Sitka default of 3 years for all profile groups except PL New User, which has an expiration of 3 months. The expiry date can be edited on all profile groups.

* *Is Group Lead Account* should always be unchecked.

* Statistical categories are used to further group patrons by categories not in the profile groups. Individual libraries can create their own patron statistical categories.

* *Save and Clone* will save the patron record and open a new patron record. Phone numbers will be copied into the new record. Depending on your library's setting, addresses may also be linked from original record, and can only be edited in original patron record.
