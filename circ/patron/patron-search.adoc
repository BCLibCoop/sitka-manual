Libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing agreements, like BC One Card, can opt-in patrons from other
participating libraries.

. When the barcode is scanned a pop-up requesting the patron's consent appears.
. Click *OK/Continue* or *Cancel* as appropriate.

If a barcode is scanned from a non-participating library a message will indicate that the patron's record
is not viewable at that library and the account cannot be opened.

[TIP]
=====
* To ensure all relevant patrons are searched,  Co-op Support recommends having _Include Inactive?_ checked.
* Libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing agreements should always set SITKA as the search library
to ensure all opted-in patrons are included in the search.
* The name fields search both the primary and preferred name fields.
* Name keywords will retrieve patrons with the specified term present in any of the name fields.
* Doing a search with _Profile Group_ set to Post-Sec Library Staff, Public Library Staff, etc. is a quick
way to retrieve all staff accounts for your library so you can review them on a regular basis to ensure
the appropriate people have access to the staff client.
