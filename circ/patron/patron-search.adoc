If a barcode is scanned from a non-participating library a message will indicate that the patron's record
is not viewable at that library and the account cannot be opened.

[TIP]
=====
* To ensure all relevant patrons are search Co-op Support recommends have _Include Inactive?_ checked.
* Libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing agreements should always set SITKA as the search library
to ensure all opted-in patrons are included in the search.
* The name fields search both the primary and preferred name fields.
* Name keywords will retrieve patrons with the specified term present in any of the name fields.
* Doing a search with _Profile Group_ set to Post-Sec Library Staff, Public Library Staff, etc. is a quick
way to retrieve all staff accounts for your library so you can review them on a regular basis to ensure 
the appropriate people have access to the staff client.

Patron Barcode Scan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Patron accounts are retrieved by barcode scan or name search.

Barcode scan is the recommended method if you have the patron's barcode: it is faster and can retrieve accounts from any Sitka library. It is also Sitka policy. Patrons from other Sitka libraries must present their library card to scan, and must "opt in" and consent to share their personal information with your library, before their account can be used at your library. Once opted in to your library, their account can also be retrieved by a name search.

. Click *Check Out Items* or select *(F1)* to scan patron's barcode.
