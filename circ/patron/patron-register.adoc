Before registering a new patron, best practice is to check for an existing account in Sitka's Evergreen. 

Public libraries with reciprocal borrowing agreements, such as BC One Card, should ask the patron if they
have a library card at another public library and then 
xref:_retrieving_an_account_via_barcode[retrieve the account via barcode].

As the registration form is completed Evergreen will alert you if the phone number, email, or address
you are entering matches that of another patron belonging to or opted in at your library.  The alert text
is a link that will take you to a patron search of the matching patrons so you can check if they are
the same patron.

. What fields display will depend on whether you're showing Required Fields, Suggested Fields, or All Fields. 
See xref:_customizing_the_display_fields[] for the settings that control which fields display.

. If you do not wish to record the address, you need to delete the fields by clicking the red X.  
Blank address fields will result in an error.

. The *Holds Notices* default setting is *Email* which makes *Email Address* a required field. You can override 
this setting, and the required field, with patron's actual preferences as needed. You must de-select 
the *Email* option to save a patron record without an email address.

. Click *Save* or *Save & Clone* at top-right of screen. *Save and Clone* will save the record 
and open a new record with some shared details such as phone number and optionally address.

for all the required fields.
