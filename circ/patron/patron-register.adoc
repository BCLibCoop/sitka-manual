in BC OneCard (5:12)*]

Before registering a new patron, best practice is to check for an existing account in Sitka's Evergreen.

Public libraries with reciprocal borrowing agreements, such as BC OneCard, should ask the patron if they
have a library card at another public library and then
xref:_retrieving_an_account_via_barcode[retrieve the account via barcode] and opt in the patron.

As the registration form is completed Evergreen will alert you if the name, phone number, email, or address
you are entering matches that of another patron belonging to or opted in at your library.  The alert text
is a link that will take you to a patron search of the matching patrons so you can check if they are
the same patron.

Registering a Patron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Select *Circulation -> Register Patron.*
. The fields that display will depend on whether you're showing Required Fields, Suggested Fields, or All Fields.
See xref:_customizing_the_display_fields[] for the settings that control which fields display.
+

+
. Enter the required information, based on your library's policies. Any fields highlighted in yellow must
be filled in.  See xref:_patron_account_fields[] for information on specific fields.
+

+
. If you do not wish to record the address, you need to delete the fields by clicking the red X.
Blank address fields will result in an error.
+

+
. The *Holds Notices* default setting is *Email* which makes *Email Address* a required field. You can override
this setting, and the required field, with the patron's actual preferences as needed. You must de-select
the *Email* option to save a patron record without an email address.
+

+
. Click *Save* or *Save & Clone* at top-right of screen. *Save & Clone* will save the record
and open a new record with some shared details such as phone number and optionally address.
+
[CAUTION]
=========
When using *Save & Clone* it is important to know whether Evergreen is linking the accounts through 
the address or merely creating a copy of the address.  Local system administrators can 
control this with the library setting _Patron Registration: Cloned patrons get address copy_.
=========

. If any required fields have been missed an alert will appear asking you to enter valid values
for all the required fields.

Managing Pending Patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries can turn on self-registration so prospective patrons can
xref:_request_a_library_card[request an account via the
public catalogue].

These self-registrations become pending patrons in Evergreen which staff can save or delete.

. In the staff client select *Circulation* -> *Pending Patrons*.

. Pending patrons for your library or branch will display.
+

+
. To create an account for the patron, select the pending patron and click the *Load Patron* button.
+
image:images/circ/pending-patrons-2.png[Managing Pending Patrons]
+
. The patron's information will be loaded into the registration form.  Fill in any additional patron information
required by your library and click *Save* to create the patron account.
+
[NOTE]
======
After loading the patron into the registration form you should click in the pre-filled fields (name, email, street address)
to trigger Evergreen to check for duplicate patrons.
======
+
. You also have the option to delete pending patron accounts if the account is determined to be duplicate or no
longer needed.  Select the pending patrons you wish to delete and click the *Delete Pending Patron(s)* button.
