Register New Patrons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you register a new patron, you need to ensure the person does not have an account in Sitka's Evergreen. Recommended practice is to ask the patron if they have a library card from another library in BC or MB, and scan that card in *Check Out Items*. If an account exists, you must ask the patron if they agree to share their personal information with your library before using the card. If changes to patron information are required, you should modify the existing patron record instead of creating a new one.

. Select *Circulation -> Register Patron.*
. Enter required information, based on your library guidelines. This screen can look  different depending on your library's choices regarding required and suggested fields, and whether or not you are displaying all fields, required fields, or suggested fields.
. Click *Save* at top-right of screen.
