Working with Patron Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The patron account has a summary, which displays on the left side of the patron account, and a tabbed interface
allowing staff to look at different aspects of the patron account.

Patron Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The patron summary pulls together pertinent information about the patron so it can be seen at a glance.

Some things of note in the patron summary.

* The patron's name displays at the top of the summary. The patron's name will be in red if they have
alerts, blocks, or owe fines.
** Evergreen will use the patron's preferred name and
fall back to the primary name if there is no preferred name.
* Any alerts and/or blocks will appear under the patron's name.
* Last Activity - Last time the patron accessed their account via My Account or the 
account was accessed for 3rd party authentication.
* Last Updated - Last time the account was updated via the *Edit* tab.
* Create Date - Date on which the account was originally created.
* Expire Date - Date on which the account will expire.  This can be updated via the *Edit* tab.
* Sitka does not use Long Overdue
* If a library used Homeroom or Student ID as _Primary Identification_ it will display in the ID1 field.
* The patron's primary name displays in the Legal Name field in the summary.
* The patron's email address is a Mail To link.
* Any addresses associated with the patron display and can be easily copied to the clipboard or printed.

The patron summary can be hidden using the arrows beside the patron's name.  This choice is sticky and
will stay on collapsed or expanded view until changed.

Check Out Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For information on the *Check Out* tab see xref:_check_out[].

Items Out Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The _Items Out_ tab shows items currently out to a patron.  It is subdivided into three tabs.

Items Checked Out
+++++++++++++++++

The _Items Checked Out_ tab shows the items currently out to the patron.

* Overdue items will display highlighted in red.
* Using the *Actions* menu staff can perform functions such as printing an items out receipt,
xref:_renewing_items[renewing items], xref:_mark_items[marking items with a different status],
and showing triggered events for notifications sent to patrons about particular items.

Other/Special Circulations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The _Other/Special Circulations_ tab shows items that are considered to be lost by the patron or that the
patron claims they have returned.

The _Fines Stopped_ column will show the reason the item has been moved to this tab.  Items are removed
from this tab when they are checked in, changed to a different status, or paid for.  See
xref:_mark_items[] for more information on handling these items.

Non-Catalogued Circulations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The _Non-Catalogued Circulations_ tab shows a count of non-catalogued items.  These items will disappear from
the patron's account when they reach their due date as non-catalogued check out is for statistical purposes
only.  See xref:_non_catalogued_items[] for more information on handling these items.

Holds Tab
^^^^^^^^^

The _Holds_ tab is divided into two tabs which show a patron's open hold requests and their recently
cancelled holds.

Open Hold Requests
++++++++++++++++++

This tab shows holds that are waiting to be filled or are ready to be picked up by the patron.

image:images/circ/holds-tab-1.png[]

Staff can xref:_placing_holds_in_patron_records[place new holds for the patron] from this tab as well
as xref:_managing_holds[manage their existing holds].

The columns _Notifications Phone Number_, _Notifications SMS Number_, and _Notify by Email?_ can be
used to determine how a patron will be or should have been notified about a particular hold.


Recently Canceled Holds
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This tab shows holds that have been cancelled.  Holds can be cancelled by the patron, by staff, or by
Evergreen.  The _Cancel Cause_ column will indicate why the hold was cancelled and from that staff can determine
whether the cancellation was done by the patron, staff, or Evergreen.
