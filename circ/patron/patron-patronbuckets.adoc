Patron Buckets allow staff to batch delete and make batch modifications to user accounts in Evergreen. Batch modifications can be made to selected fields in the patron account:

* Home Library
* Profile Group
* Network Access Level
* Barred flag
* Active flag
* Juvenile flag
* Privilege Expiration Date
* Statistical Categories

Batch modifications and deletions can be rolled back or reversed, with the exception of batch changes to statistical categories. Batch changes made in User Buckets will not activate any Action/Trigger event definitions that would normally be activated when editing an individual account.

Patron accounts can be added to Patron Buckets by scanning individual patron barcodes or by uploading a file of patron barcodes directly in the Patron Bucket interface. They can also be added to a Patron Bucket from the Patron Search screen. Batch changes and batch edit sets are tied to the Patron Bucket itself, not to the login of the bucket owner.
