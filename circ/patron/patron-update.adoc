Update Patron Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Routine maintenance of your patron accounts includes updating patrons' contact information, renewing expired library cards, marking library cards lost, re-setting patrons' passwords, inserting  notes or alert messages, and so on. It is good practice to understand how the patron account record functions.

. Scan the patron barcode or search for patron by name.
. Once the patron record is loaded, *Check Out* is the default tab.
. Click *Edit* to retrieve patron information.
. Make required edits and click *Save* at top right of screen.

Once a library card is marked lost, Evergreen marks the card inactive and keeps it in the database. If the patron has lost a library card before, the *See All* button shows up.

. Click *See All*. All barcodes that the patron has had are displayed in a pop-up window.
. Click *Active*  to activate an inactive card.
. Click *Primary*  on the Active card, Active must be the Primary Card.
. Click *Apply Changes* and *Save*.

Re-set Patron Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Click *Reset Password* or enter a new password and click *Save*.
. If your library uses the last 4 digits of phone number as default password, please do not use *Reset Password* button. Instead, enter the new phone number, and click *Save*.

TIP: Existing password is not displayed in patron records for security reasons.

Invalidate Email Address or Phone Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is good practice to keep patron email addresses current to ensure service from Evergreen's automated messaging features. The *Invalidate* option alerts staff that a new email address is required, and removes the invalid address.

NOTE: Accumulated bounced back emails may result in courtesy and notice emails from Evergreen being blocked by some email service providers such as Gmail and Outlook/Hotmail. This denial of service affects all Sitka's Evergreen users, and we request your cooperation in maintaining current email addresses.

Update Patron Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Retrieve the patron account and click *Edit*.
. Scroll down to *Address* to edit it, and click *Save*.
. To delete an address, click the red coloured cross, and click *Save*.
. To add a new address, click *New Address* at the bottom of Address section, and enter required information.
. Select *Mailing* or *Physical* and click *Save*.

Unlinking Shared Patron Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your library links addresses in cloned accounts, the address in the new, cloned record is greyed out, and can only be edited in the original record. The address' owning account can not be deleted or merged when other accounts are still using the address, so there are times when you need to unlink shared addresses. You do this by adding a new address to the cloned patron account record.

. Click  *New Address* button.
. Click  *Mailing* and *Physical* address and click *Save*.
. The linked address is replaced.
