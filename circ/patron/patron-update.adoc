+
. Click *Save* at top right of screen.

[NOTE]
======
*Update Expire Date* will give a date 3 years in the future for all Permission Groups except PL New User, 
which gets a date 3 months in the future.

Libraries can manually edit the expiry date to match their local policy.
======


Marking a Library Card Lost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Click *Replace Barcode*
+

+
. Enter the new barcode.
+
image:images/circ/patronupdate8.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+ 
. If the username is still the original barcode, update it to match new barcode number.
. Click *Save* at top right of screen.


See All Barcodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When patron accounts are merged together or a patron barcode is replaced, Evergreen marks the barcode as inactive 
and keeps it in the database. 

If a patron presents an inactive card Evergreen will retrieve the account with a warning that the barcode is inactive and 
will not allow check outs. Staff can then decide which cards should be active or 
inactive. Best practice is to delete inactive patron cards.

. Click *See All*.
+
image:images/circ/patronupdate4.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. All barcodes that the patron has had are displayed in a pop-up window.
. Click *Active*  to activate an inactive card.
. Click *Primary*  on the Active card, Active must be the Primary Card.
. Click *Apply Changes*.
+

. Click *Save* at top right of screen.


Re-setting a Patron Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Co-op Support recommends libraries encourage their patrons to use the 
xref:_resetting_your_password[Forgot Your Password link] in the public catalogue for password resets whenever possible.
When needed it is also possible for staff to reset a patron's password in the staff client.  This should be a temporary
password and patrons should be encouraged to sign into _My Account_ and update the password to something secure that 
only they know.

. Click *Generate Password* to generate a random 4 digit password or type a new password into the field.
+
image:images/circ/patronupdate10.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. If your library uses the last 4 digits of phone number as default password, you may wish to set the password to match
their phone number.
. Click *Save* at top right of screen.

[TIP]
======
The existing password is not displayed in patron records for security reasons.
======

Update and Test Email Address or SMS/Text Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Enter new email address or SMS number, and click *Save*.
. Click *Send Test Email* or *Send Test Text.*
+
image:images/circ/patronupdate5.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. Confirm with the patron whether or not they received the test email or text message.

Invalidating an Email Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is good practice to keep patron email addresses current to ensure service from Evergreen's 
automated messaging features. If an email to a patron bounces back you can invalidate the email address.

. Click *Invalidate*.
+
image:images/circ/patronupdate11.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. The email address will be removed and a penalty will be added to the *Messages* tab which will display when the 
patron's account is retrieved.
+
image:images/circ/patronupdate12.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. Evergreen will automatically archive the penalty when a new email address is entered.
. To resolve the penalty manually see xref:_staff_generated_alerts_blocks_and_notes[].



[NOTE]
======
Accumulated bounced back emails may result in notification emails from 
Evergreen being blocked by some email service providers such as Gmail and Outlook/Hotmail. 
This denial of service affects all Sitka's Evergreen users and we request your cooperation 
in maintaining current email addresses.
======

Invalidating a Phone Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is good practice to invalidate phone numbers that are no longer valid for your patron to prevent staff from
continuing to call an out of service number or a phone number that has been re-assigned to a different person.

. Click *Invalidate*.
+
image:images/circ/patronupdate14.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. The phone number will be removed and a penalty will be added to the *Messages* tab which will display when the 
patron's account is retrieved.
. To resolve the penalty manually see xref:_staff_generated_alerts_blocks_and_notes[].

Invalidating an Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is good practice to invalidate addresses that are no longer valid.  Paper overdues do not check whether an
address is valid so staff handling paper overdues should have a method for tracking notices returned to sender.

. Uncheck the check box *Valid Address?*.
. Click *Save*.
. If the library setting _Invalid patron address penalty_ is set to False for your library the box
 will simply be unchecked.
. If the library setting _Invalid patron address penalty_ is set to True for your library a penalty will
be applied that can be seen in the Messages tab.  Additionally, in the summary the address label will appear
in red.

Update Patron Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Retrieve the patron account and click *Edit*.
. Scroll down to *Address* to edit it, and click *Save*.
. To delete an address, click the red coloured cross, and click *Save*.
. To add a new address, click *New Address* at the bottom of Address section, and enter required information.
. Select *Mailing* or *Physical* and click *Save*.

Unlinking Shared Patron Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your library links addresses in cloned accounts, the address in the new, cloned record is greyed out, and 
can only be edited in the original record. The address' owning account can not be deleted or merged when 
other accounts are still using the address, so there are times when you need to unlink shared addresses. 
You do this by adding a new address to the cloned patron account record.

. Uncheck the checkboxes for *Mailing* and *Physical* on the shared address.
. Click  *New Address* button.
. Check the checkboxes for *Mailing* and *Physical* on the new address.
. Enter the address and click *Save*.
. The linked address is replaced.
