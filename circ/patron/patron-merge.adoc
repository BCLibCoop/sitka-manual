. Click *Merge*.

. The accounts will be merged together.  The notes, bills, holds, and outstanding items from the
non-lead card are transferred to the lead account and the non-lead card is marked inactive by default.

[TIP]
=====
If you scan an inactive card on the Check Out screen, Evergreen will retrieve the account 
and show the message _Patron
account retrieved with an INACTIVE card._

Co-op Support recommends manually deleting inactive cards using the 
xref:_deleting_inactive_cards[Patron Deletion Tool] or automatically deleting inactive cards by setting 
the library setting _Patron Merge Barcode Delete_ to True.
