Merge Patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: Local System Administration permission is required to merge patron accounts. Patron accounts 
can only be merged if both accounts have the same home library; you may need to update the home library 
in one of the accounts before merging.

. Click *Search* -> *Search for Patrons*.
. Search by terms shared by the two accounts such as name or phone number.
. Select the checkboxes for the two accounts you want to merge and click *Merge Patrons*.
. Check the radio button *Use as lead* above the account you want to keep.
. Click *Merge* at bottom right of screen.

Inactive Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the two accounts have been merged, the notes, bills, holds, and outstanding items on the 
non-lead card are transferred to the lead account, and the non-lead card is marked inactive.  

It is good practice to  delete the inactive card. Your library can also choose to automatically 
delete the inactive card by configuring the Library Setting _Patron Merge Barcode Delete_ to True.

NOTE: If you scan an inactive card on the Check Out screen, Evergreen retrieves the active account, 
and provides an informative message. The situation can be managed as per local policy.
