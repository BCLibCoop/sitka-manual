Offline Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CAUTION: Sitka Support strongly recommends that you only use *Offline Circulation* for Check Out & Renew.

Check Out
^^^^^^^^^

To check out items in *Offline Circulation*:

. Click the *Checkout* tab.
. Enter a value in the *Due Date* field or select a date from the Calendar widget.  You may also select an option from the *Offset Dropdown*.  The date field entry will honor the format set in the Library Settings Editor.
. Scan the Patron Barcode in the box labelled *Patron Barcode*.
. Check out items:
.. For cataloged items, scan the item barcode in the box labelled *Item Barcode*.  Each item barcode will appear on the right side of the screen, along with its due date and the patron barcode.  If you are manually typing barcodes, you need to click the *Checkout* button or hit the *Enter* key on your keyboard after each Item Barcode entry in order to record the transaction.
.. For non-cataloged items, select a *Non-cataloged Type* from the dropdown and enter the number of items you wish to check out.  Click *Checkout*.  In the list to the right, the item barcode will appear blank since this item is unbarcoded.  The due date and patron barcode will appear, however.
.. If you make an error in entry, click *Clear* to reset the Patron Barcode and Item Barcode fields.
. Make sure *Strict Barcode* is unchecked.
. To print a receipt, check *Print Receipt*.

.. *Save Transactions* will save any unsaved transactions across the Offline tabs Checkout, Renew, In-House Use, and Checkin.

[NOTE]
==================
* A value entered in the Due Date field will take precedence over an existing value in the Offset Dropdown; however, if you change the Offset after setting the Due Date field, the Due Date field will update to reflect the Offset value.

* Due Date and Offset values are sticky between the Checkout and Renew tabs, and also sticky between transactions.  Strict Barcode and Print Receipt are sticky among the Checkout, Renew, In-House Use, and Checkin tabs and are also sticky between transactions.

* Pre-cataloged item checkout is not available in Offline Circulation.  Any pre-cataloged item checked out through Offline Circulation will result in an entry in the Exception List and will not successfully check out.
==================

Renew
^^^^^

To renew an item, you must know the item's barcode number. The patron's barcode is optional.

To renew items in Offline Circulation:

. Click the *Renew* tab.
. Ensure that the *Due Date* value is correct.
. For each item to be renewed, scan the item's barcode in the *Item Barcode* field. If you are typing the item barcode, click the *Renew* button or hit the *Enter* key on your keyboard after each item barcode.
. _(Optional)_: Enter the patron's library card barcode in the *Patron Barcode* field by scanning or typing the barcode.
. The item barcode, due date, and patron barcode (if entered) appear on the right side of the screen.

. Enter the number of uses to record for the item in the *Use Count* field.
. For each item to be recorded as in-house use, scan the item's barcode in the *Item Barcode* field. If you are typing the item barcode, click the *Record Use* button or hit the *Enter* key on your keyboard after each item barcode.
. The item barcode and use count will appear on the right side of the screen.
. To print a receipt, check *Print Receipt*.
. Click *Save Transactions* in the upper-right of the screen to record the in-house use.  The date of the in-house use is automatically recorded.

Check In
^^^^^^^^

To *Check In* items in *Offline Circulation*:

. Click the *Checkin* tab.
. Ensure that the *Due Date* value is correct.  It will default to today's date.
. For each item to be checked in, scan the item's barcode in the *Item Barcode* field. If you are typing the item barcode, click the *Checkin* button or hit the *Enter* key on your keyboard after each item barcode.
. To print a receipt, check the box labelled *Print Receipt*.
. Click *Save Transactions* in the upper-right of the screen when you are finished entering checkins.

[NOTE]
=============
* Existing pre-cataloged items can be checked in through the Offline interface, but they will generate an entry in the Exceptions list when offline transactions are uploaded and processed.

* Items targeted for holds will be captured for their holds when the offline transactions are uploaded and processed; however, there will be no indication in the Exceptions list about this unless the item is also transiting.
=============

Patron Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patron registration in *Offline Circulation* records patron information for upload later.  The Patron Registration form in Offline is the same as the regular Patron Registration interface.

All fields in the normal Patron Registration interface are available for entry.  Required fields are marked in yellow and adhere to Required Fields set in the *Library Settings Editor*.  Patron Registration defaults also adhere to settings in the *Library Settings Editor*.  Stat cats are not recognized by *Offline Circulation*, even if they are required.

Enter patron information and click the *Save* button in the top-right of the Patron Registration interface.  You may checkout items to this patron right away, even if you are still in offline mode.

NOTE: To prevent duplicate patron entry we stronly recommend that you do not use patron registration in offline modern
