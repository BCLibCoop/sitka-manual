Check In
~~~~~~~~

To Check In items in Offline Circulation:

. Click the *Checkin* tab.
. Ensure that the *Due Date* value is correct.  It will default to today's date.
. For each item to be checked in, scan the item's barcode in the *Item Barcode* field. If you are typing the item barcode, click the *Checkin* button or hit the *Enter* key on your keyboard after each item barcode.
. To print a receipt, check the box labelled *Print Receipt*.
. Click *Save Transactions* in the upper-right of the screen when you are finished entering checkins.

NOTE: Existing pre-cataloged items can be checked in through the Offline interface, but they will generate an entry in the Exceptions list when offline transactions are uploaded and processed.

Items targeted for holds will be captured for their holds when the offline transactions are uploaded and processed; however, there will be no indication in the Exceptions list about this unless the item is also transiting.
