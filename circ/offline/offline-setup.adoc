Set up Workstations for Offline Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Prior to using Offline Circulation, you need to do the following, which requires network access:


. *Register the workstation* in the recommended browser on the computers you intend to use. Local System Administrator's account is required to do this.
+
. *Load configuration information* by performing a patron search. Select any patron on the result list. Go to Edit tab. The relevant configuration information for the workstation is downloaded during this process.
+
. *Set up a default printer* for Offline Circulation, if you use Hatch.  Go to *Administration -> Workstation -> Printer Settings*.
+
. *Save the Offline Circulation URL* as a Chrome Bookmark.

Save Offline URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The permanent link for *Offline Circulation* is *https://catalogue.libraries.coop/eg/staff/offline-interface* . We recommend that this link is bookmarked on staff workstations.  This is the location for both entering transactions while offline as well as processing them later.  You will see a slightly different version of this interface depending on whether or not you are logged in.

////
* If you are logged out, you will see the tab default to *Checkout* and the button on the top-right will read *Export Transactions*.

* If you are logged in, you will see an additional tab on the left for *Session Management* and this will be the default tab.

* If you are logged in and attempt to click on any tab other than *Session Management*, you will see a warning alerting you that you are about to enter offline mode.
