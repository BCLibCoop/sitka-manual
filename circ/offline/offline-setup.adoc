Offline Workstation Set up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Prior to using *Offline Circulation*, you need to do the following:


*Register the workstation* in the recommended browser on the computers you intend to use. Local system administrator's account is required to do it.

*Load configuration information* by performing a patron search. On the result list, select any patron. Go to Edit tab. The relevent configuration information for the workstation is loaded during this process. 

*Download Offline Block List*. The list contains patrons with blocks at the time of the download. *Offline Circulation* will check patrons against this list and prompt staff if a patron is found on the list.

To download the block list, navigate to *Circulation -> Offline Circulation*. Click *Download Block List* button in the top-right of the screen.

Download Offline Block List

While logged in and still online, you may download an *Offline Block List*.  This will locally store a list of all patrons with blocks at the time of the download.  If this list is present, *Offline Circulation* will check transactions against this list.

To download the block list, navigate to *Circulation* -> *Offline Circulation* and click the *Download Block List* button in the top-right of the screen.

If you attempt a checkout or a renewal for a patron on the block list, you will get a modal informing you that the patron has penalties.  Click the *Allow* button to override this and proceed with the transaction.  Click the *Reject* button to cancel the checkout or renewal.
