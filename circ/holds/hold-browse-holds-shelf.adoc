Clearing Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two types of clearable holds:

* _Cancelled Holds_ - holds that patrons or library staff have cancelled after they were already on the holds
shelf.
* _Expired Holds_ - holds have been on the holds shelf past your library's hold shelf expire interval.

[NOTE]
======
Evergreen calculates a hold's expire time based on the value entered for the library setting 
_Default hold shelf expire interval_.
======

To clear these holds:

. On the holds shelf, click the *Show Clearable Holds* button.
+

. Pull all the cleared items from the holds shelf.

if there is another patron on hold.
