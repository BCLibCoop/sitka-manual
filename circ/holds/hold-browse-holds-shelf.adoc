Items with *Ready for Pickup* status are on the *Holds Shelf* list. The function of the list is to 
help you manage items on the holds shelf, such as cancelling expired holds.

Clearable Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two types of clearable holds:

* _Cancelled Holds_ - holds that patrons or library staff have cancelled after they were already on the holds
shelf.
* _Expired Holds_ - holds have been on the holds shelf past your library's hold shelf expire interval.

To clear these holds:

. On the holds shelf, click the *Show Clearable Holds* button.
