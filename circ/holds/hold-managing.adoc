Marking Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a hold has an item assigned to it the item can be marked as _Damaged_, _Discard/Weed_, or 
_Missing_ via the *Actions* menu.

For more information on marking items with these statuses see xref:_mark_items[].

Retargetting Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Re-Target Holds)))
(((Holds, Re-Target Holds)))



Newly created items, or items whose status was just changed from a non-holdable to a holdable status, 
may not trigger holds on regular check in.  This is because Evergreen automatically updates the table of 
items eligible to fill a particular hold every 24 hours.  Library staff can retarget holds which forces
Evergreen to update the table of eligible items right away.  

You can re-target local holds in two ways:

* on the check in screen, using the xref:_check_in_modifiers[checkin modifiers] _Retarget Local Holds_ 
and _Retarget All Statuses_.
* by manually re-targetting the hold from staff catalogue or patron account.

[TIP]
=====
Co-op Support recommends multi-branch libraries manually re-target holds through the staff catalogue
or paton account in order to retarget all holds in the system. For single branch libraries, Co-op Support 
recommends using the retarget related checkin modifiers at check in.
=====

. On the _View Holds_ tab in the staff catalogue or on the _Holds_ tab in the patron's account, select 
the hold you wish to retarget and go to *Actions -> Find Another Target*.
+
image:images/circ/holds/retarget-hold-1.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. Click *Retarget*.
. The hold is retargeted.  If there is an item available to fill the hold it will be assigned to the hold
with the hold status of _Waiting for Capture_.  
. Check in the item to capture the hold.
