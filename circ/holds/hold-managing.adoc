Managing Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Holds, Holds Management)))
(((Holds, Holds Edit)))

Staff can edit holds in patrons' records or in title records. Patrons can edit their holds in their account on your public catalogue.

Holds can be cancelled at any time by staff or patrons. Before holds are captured, staff or patrons can suspend a hold without losing the hold queue position, can activate suspended holds, and can change notification method, phone number, pick-up location, and expiration date.  Once a hold is captured, staff can change the pickup location and extend the hold shelf time if required.

Set Desired Item Condition/Quality
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[[_modify_holds_quality]]

Co-op Support does not recommend the use of Item Quality/Condition.

Edit Pickup Library
+++++++++++++++++++
[[_modify_holds_pickup_library]]



. Select hold in patron record and click *Actions -> Edit Pickup Library*
. Click the dropdown list of all libraries, choose the new pickup location, and click *Submit*.


TIP: For libraries sharing resources with other libraries, Co-op Support strongly recommends you do not edit pickup location. Best practice is to cancel the hold and place another hold with new pickup location. There may be eligible copies at the new location, but the hold targeter will not find them if you just change the pickup library. Editing the pickup location in the existing hold will not force Evergreen to re-target the eligible copies.

Edit Notification Settings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[[_modify_holds_notification_settings]]

. Select hold in patron record and click *Actions -> Edit Notification Settings*.
. Edit as required and click *Submit*.
+

+
. Use calendar widgets or enter dates for required action and click *Submit*.

[TIP]
=====
Suspended holds will not be filled but their hold position is kept. If there is no 
activation date, suspended holds remain inactive until staff or patrons activate 
them manually.

Suspended holds with activation dates will be automatically activated after hours 
on the activation date, regardless of the time displayed in the Activation Date field. For example, a 
suspended hold with an activation date of January 10th will be active for January 11th. 
=====


Top of Queue
++++++++++++
[[_modify_holds_queue]]

. Click *Actions -> Set Top of Queue* to move the selected hold to the top of the hold queue.
+
image:images/circ/manageholds5.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. Click *Un-Set Top of Queue* to remove a hold from the top of the queue.

TIP: If an item has already been assigned to the hold on top of the queue,  you need to suspend the old top hold, *Find Another Target* for the new top hold, then activate the old top hold.

TIP: You can also edit hold position by clicking *Edit Hold Dates -> Hold Request Date*. For most libraries, holds are filled based on request time sequence. Changing request time will change the holds fulfillment sequence.

Cancelling Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Select *Cancel Hold* from the *Actions* menu.
. Choose the appropriate cancel reason from the drop down menu.  Applicable cancel reasons are _Patron via phone_,
_Patron in person_, and _Staff forced_.  The other listed cancel reasons apply to automated cancellations.
+

anything entered into the _Notes_ field when cancelling a hold appears as the Cancel Cause in the email

Marking Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a hold has an item assigned to it the item can be marked as _Damaged_, _Discard/Weed_, or 
_Missing_ via the *Actions* menu.

For more information on marking items with these statuses see xref:_mark_items[].



Re-Targetting Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Re-Target Holds)))
(((Holds, Re-Target Holds)))

Newly created items, or items whose status was just changed from a non-holdable to a holdable status, may not trigger holds on regular check-in because these copies are not yet identified as hold targets. The holds targeter will eventually target such holds overnight, or you can re-target them immediately. Re-targeting a hold means Evergreen searches for an available copy for the hold right away, and puts it on the *Holds Pull List* if found. If there is no available copy, the hold's status will be set to *Wait for copy*.

You can re-target local holds at check-in by use of *Checkin Modifiers*, or you can manually re-target holds from title, patron, or hold record as follows.


. Select the hold from any hold management screen and click *Actions -> Find Another Target*.
+
image:images/circ/retarget1.png[scaledwidth="75%"]


TIP:  Co-op Support recommends multi-branch libraries use *Find Another Target*, as described above, in order to re-target all holds in the system. For single branch libraries, Co-op Support recommends the check-in modifiers *Retarget Local Holds* and *Retarget All Statuses* be enabled. These check-in modifiers are sticky.





View Hold Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Select the hold and click *Detail View*. Useful information about the hold is displayed.
. Click *New Note* or *Staff Notifications* to add information as required.

TIP: Notes can be printed on the hold slip if the *Print on Slip?* checkbox is selected.
