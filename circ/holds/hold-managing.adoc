Managing Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staff can edit holds in patrons' records or in title records. Patrons can edit their holds in their account on your public catalogue.

Holds can be cancelled at any time by staff or patrons. Before holds are captured, staff or patrons can suspend a hold without losing the hold queue position, can activate suspended holds, and can change notification method, phone number, pick-up location, and expiration date.  Once a hold is captured, staff can change the pickup location and extend the hold shelf time if required.


Hold Statuses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are five types of status a hold may have: *Waiting for Copy*, *Waiting for Capture*, *In Transit*, *Ready for Pickup*, and the optional *Reserved/Pending*. If your library chooses to delay hold shelf status, then a hold may have the status of *Reserved/Pending*.

* Waiting-for-copy: all holdable copies are checked out or not available.

* Waiting-for-capture: an available copy is assigned to the hold. The item is on the *Holds Pull List*, waiting for staff to search the shelf and capture the hold.

* In Transit: hold is captured at a non-pickup library and on the way to the pick-up location.

* Ready for Pickup: hold is captured and on the *Holds Shelf* for patron to pick up. In the catalogue, this status displays as *On Holds Shelf*.

* Reserved/Pending: hold is captured, item is in process, and yet to be put on the *Holds Shelf*. The status will be automatically changed to *Ready for Pickup* once the delay period specified in Library Settings Editor expires.

Edit Pickup Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Select hold in patron record and click *Actions -> Edit Pickup Library*
. Click the dropdown list of all libraries, choose the new pickup location, and click *Submit*.


TIP: For libraries sharing resources with other libraries, Co-op Support strongly recommends you do not edit pickup location. Best practice is to cancel the hold and place another hold with new pickup location. There may be eligible copies at the new location, but the hold targeter will not find them if you just change the pickup library. Editing the pickup location in the existing hold will not force Evergreen to re-target the eligible copies.

Edit Hold Queue Position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Click *Actions -> Set Top of Queue* to move the selected hold to the top of the hold queue.
+

+
. Click *Un-Set Top of Queue* to remove a hold from the top of the queue.

TIP: If an item has already been assigned to the hold on top of the queue,  you need to suspend the old top hold, *Find Another Target* for the new top hold, then activate the old top hold.

TIP: You can also edit hold position by clicking *Edit Hold Dates -> Hold Request Date*. For most libraries, holds are filled based on request time sequence. Changing request time will change the holds fulfillment sequence.

Cancelled Holds

. Click *Recently Canceled Holds* tab on patron's *Holds* screen.
. Select a hold and click *Actions -> Uncancel Hold* if needed.
