Items that are available on your shelf and have been requested to fill a hold will appear on the pull 
list for hold requests.  Staff can print the list, pull the items from the shelf,and then check them
in to capture the holds.  Co-op Support recommends checking the pull list at once day; libraries 
that handle a large volume of holds may find the pull list needs to be checked throughout the day.

[NOTE]
======
The _Pickup Library_ column will show which library the item is going to to fill the hold.  Libraries
participating in Interlibrary Connect can use this column to distinguish between local and ILC holds
and may choose not to pull ILC holds on a day their Interlibrary Loan staff member is away.

Evergreen will re-target ILC holds to another library after 24 hours if the item hasn't
been captured for a hold, unless there is no other item in the ILC zone that can fill the hold.
