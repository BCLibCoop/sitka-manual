Items that are available on your shelf and have been requested to fill a hold will appear on the pull 
list for hold requests.  Staff can print the list, pull the items from the shelf, and then check them
in to capture the holds.  Co-op Support recommends checking the pull list at once day; libraries with a 
high volume of holds may find it beneficial to check the list multiple times a day.



. Go to *Circulation → Pull List for Hold Requests*.
. The pull list displays. By default the items on the list are grouped first by shelving location, 
then by call number.

[TIP]
=====
The order the shelving locations display in can be adjusted to better reflect the physical arrangement of
your shelves.  For information on re-ordering your shelving locations see xref:_shelving_location_order[].
=====
+
. Multi-branch libraries can use the library selector to look at the pull lists for any of their branches.

up at a particular library or branch.

Interlibrary Connect and the Pull List for Hold Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



[NOTE]
======
The _Pickup Library_ column will show which library the item is going to to fill the hold.  Libraries
participating in Interlibrary Connect can use this column to distinguish between local and ILC holds
and may choose not to pull ILC holds on a day their Interlibrary Loan staff member is away.

Evergreen will re-target ILC holds to another library after 24 hours if the item hasn't
been captured for a hold, unless there is no other item in the ILC zone that can fill the hold.
