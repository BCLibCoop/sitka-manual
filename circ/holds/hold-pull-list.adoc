Items that are available on your shelf and have been requested to fill a hold will appear on the pull 
list for hold requests.  Staff can print the list, pull the items from the shelf, and then check them
in to capture the holds.  Co-op Support recommends checking the pull list at once day; libraries with a 
high volume of holds may find it beneficial to check the list multiple times a day.



. Go to *Circulation → Pull List for Hold Requests*.
. The pull list displays. By default the items on the list are grouped first by shelving location, 
then by call number.

[TIP]
=====
The order the shelving locations display in can be adjusted to better reflect the physical arrangement of
your shelves.  For information on re-ordering your shelving locations see xref:_shelving_location_order[].
=====
+
. Multi-branch libraries can use the library selector to look at the pull lists for any of their branches.

. The _Pickup Library_ filter can be used to filter the pull list to show items to be picked 
up at a particular library or branch.

printing and downloading options.
. Pull the items from your shelves and check them in to 
xref:_capturing_holds_and_hold_transits[capture the holds].
. Items that cannot be found should have their status set to _Missing_ via the Actions menu.

Printing and Downloading the Pull List for Hold Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three ways to print the pull list for hold requests and one way to download it.  In all
cases the list will only include the items the items currently displaying on the screen.

Print Full List
+++++++++++++++

The *Print Full List* button will open a print dialogue and allow you to print the list.  The columns 
that print will depend on the library’s print template for the Hold Pull List. See 
xref:https://asciidoc.libraries.coop/sitka-manual-master/html/_print_templates.html[] for information
on print templates.

Interlibrary Connect and the Pull List for Hold Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries participating in Interlibrary Connect should ensure they always have the _Pickup Library_ 
column visible in the grid to easily distinguish between local and ILC holds.

In the event of a short closure of ILC, the _Pickup Library_ filter can be used so that only local holds
are visible and appear on printed lists.

If an item on the pull list is not captured for an ILC hold within 24 hours, Evergreen will re-target 
the ILC hold to another library, unless there is no other item in the ILC zone that can fill the hold.

If an item cannot be found it is especially important for ILC libraries to set that item to _Missing_ so
that Evergreen knows it cannot be used to fill the hold.  If the item is the only item in the ILC zone
that could fill the hold, once the item is set to _Missing_ the hold will be moved to the pickup library's
xref:_hopeless_holds[hopeless holds] list and the pickup library can then resolve the hold.
