Managing Hold Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Holds, Hold Groups)))

https://youtu.be/WpbGpyJX9Dg[*Sitka Snippet Video - Hold Groups (2:45)*]

The Hold Groups feature allows library staff to create lists of patrons that can then be used 
to place multiple title-level holds on the same bibliographic record. This is useful for book clubs, 
new or on-order items, and/or high demand items.

[TIP]
=====
Libraries may wish to set up a mechanism by which patrons can subscribe to be added to a hold group.  For
 example, a library may set up a form on their website with a list of authors to select from that is 
 sent to library staff so they can add the patron to the selected author hold groups.

. On the Hold Groups tab, double-click the Hold Group you wish to modify. This will open the Hold Group in the Current Users tab.
. Click the Hold Groups button and choose Edit Hold Group.
. The Edit Bucket pop-up will open. You can edit the name, description, owning library, or visibility.

Adding Users to a Hold Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patrons can be added to a Hold Group by barcode, by searching for a patron with an integrated patron search on the Add Users tab, or by a normal patron search. Staff must have PLACE_HOLD permissions to add patrons to a Hold Group at least at the same organizational unit depth (library) as the patron they are trying to add. For example, a staff member with branch level permissions for Branch A could only add patrons to Hold Groups owned by Branch A. If they needed to add patrons to Branch B or Branch C too, they would need system or consortial-level permissions.

.Add Users By Barcode
. *Circulation* -> *Hold Groups*.
. Double-click the name of the Hold Group you wish to add patrons to.
. Go to the Add Users tab.
+

. Scan or enter the patron barcode into the Scan Barcode field.
.. Added patrons appear in a list under the Add All To Hold Group button. Users in this list are considered pending and have not yet been added to the Hold Group. Note that the parenthetical number for Add Users increases to display the number of pending users.
.. Continue adding barcodes as needed.
. From the list, select one or more users with the checkboxes at the beginning of each row or select all users with the checkbox at the list.
. Click *Actions* -> *Add to Hold Group*.

.Add Users With Integrated Patron Search
. *Circulation* -> *Hold Groups*.
. Double-click the name of the Hold Group you wish to add patrons to.
. Go to the Add Users tab.
. Click *Search for Patron*. A patron search pop-up opens.
.. The search is scoped to the workstation of the logged in staff member, but can be expanded by using the additional search fields.
. Enter search criteria into the appropriate fields.
.. The pop-up defaults to the basic patron search. Additional search fields are available by clicking the down-arrow button to the right of the Search button. This option is sticky.
. Click *Search* or hit the Enter key. Results appear in the bottom portion of the pop-up window.
. Click anywhere on a row in the results list to select that patron.
. Click *Select*. The patron is added to the list of pending users. Users on this list have not yet been added to the Hold Group. Note that the parenthetical number for Add Users increases to display the number of pending users.
Continue adding patrons as needed.
. From the list, select one or more users with the checkboxes at the beginning of each row or select all users with the checkbox at the list.
. Click *Actions* -> *Add to Hold Group*.
. The users will now appear on the Current Users tab as part of the Hold Group.

NOTE: You can add some or all of the users in the pending users list to different Hold Groups without entering barcodes or searching again. Simply go to the Hold Groups tab and double-click another Hold Group from the list. Return to the Add Users tab and select the users you wish to add to the new Hold Group, and use the Actions menu to add them to the Hold Group.

. Choose the Hold Group to which you want to add the patron(s).
