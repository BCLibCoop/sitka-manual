Managing Hold Groups

(((Holds, Hold Groups)))

Hold groups allow library staff to create lists of patrons that can then be used 
to place multiple title level holds on the same bibliographic record. This is useful for book clubs, 
new or on-order items, and/or high demand items.

[TIP]
=====
Libraries may wish to set up a mechanism by which patrons can subscribe to be added to a hold group.  For
 example, a library may set up a form on their website with a list of authors to select from that is 
 sent to library staff so they can add the patron to the selected author hold groups.
