Hold Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Holds, Hold Groups)))

The Hold Groups feature allows library staff to create lists of patrons that can then be used to place multiple title-level holds on the same bibliographic record. This is useful for book clubs, new or on-order items, and/or high demand items.

Create a Hold Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.Create a New Hold Group
. *Circulation* -> *Hold Groups*.
. On the Hold Group tab, click New Hold Group.
. Enter a name for the Hold Group.
. Enter a description for the Hold Group (optional).
. Choose the owning library from the drop down (defaults to the workstation library).

NOTE: Hold Groups are visible only to the staff member who created them but can be shared through Bucket ID.

Add Users to a Hold Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patrons can be added to a Hold Group by barcode, by searching for a patron with an integrated patron search on the Add Users tab, or by a normal patron search. Staff must have PLACE_HOLD permissions to add patrons to a Hold Group at least at the same organizational unit depth (library) as the patron they are trying to add. For example, a staff member with branch level permissions for Branch A could only add patrons to Hold Groups owned by Branch A. If they needed to add patrons to Branch B or Branch C too, they would need system or consortial-level permissions.

.Add Users By Barcode
