(((Holds, Hopeless Holds)))



A hold is considered hopeless when there are no copies in Evergreen's "hold_copy_map" for a title,  or, when all copies in the  "hold_copy_map" are in a item status with "hopeless_prone" set to True. In Sitka's Evergreen, those statuses are globally set at Discard/Weed, Damaged, Lost, Lost and Paid, and Missing, and are administered by Co-op Support.


Managing Hopeless Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unfulfillable holds are colloquially known as “hopeless holds.” In previous versions of Evergreen, staff relied on reports to generate lists of such holds. In Sitka's Evergreen version 3.7, the new Hopeless Holds interface provides staff with an easy way to retrieve a list of unfulfillable holds, and perform actions on them to move them out of their hopeless condition.

Hopeless Holds Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Hopeless Holds interface is accessed through *Administration → Local Administration → Hopeless Holds.* All staff with permissions to view and modify holds can access Hopeless Holds.

The interface displays a grid similar to that of Holds Requests, with a list of holds that are considered unfulfillable. Requests are added to this list based on whether there is a value in the Hopeless Date field. Evergreen's hold targeter assigns this date in the field,  whenever it cannot find a potential target.


The list of hold requests can be filtered by hopeless date range and/or pickup library. Pickup library defaults to the workstation library and retrieves results for the selected library and its descendents.

All columns in the grid can be sorted by clicking the column header. The following columns are visible by default:

Hold ID

Patron Barcode

Request Date

Hold Type

Pickup Library

Title

Holdable Formats

Hopeless Date

Status

Part Label

Additional columns are available through the column picker, including the standard column options associated with Holds.

After selecting one or more hold requests from the list, staff can use the Actions menu to perform a variety of tasks. All actions activate new tabs for each selected record. Available actions are similar to those found in other holds-related menus (e.g., Cancel Hold, Modify Hold(s), Find Another Target.)

Additional actions include:

Add Holdings - opens the selected bibliographic records in the Holdings Editor for the purposes of adding new items to the records; this action is disabled if there are metarecord holds among the selected requests

Show in Catalog - opens the selected bibliographic records in OPAC view

View/Place Orders - opens the selected bibliographic records in Acquisitions, where staff can add the titles to a selection list, add the titles to an existing purchase order, or create a new purchase order; this action is disabled if there are metarecord holds among the selected requests
