Hopeless Holds

(((Holds)))
(((Holds, Hopeless Holds)))



A hold is considered hopeless when there are no copies in Evergreen's "hold_copy_map" for a title,  or when all copies in the  "hold_copy_map" are in a item status with the hopeless_prone property set to “True”. In Sitka's Evergreen those statuses are globally set at Discard/Weed, Damaged, Lost, Lost and Paid, and Missing, and are administered by Co-op Support.


Managing Hopeless Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unfulfillable holds are colloquially known as “hopeless holds.” In previous versions of Evergreen, staff relied on reports to generate lists of such holds. In Sitka's Evergreen version 3.7, the new Hopeless Holds interface provides staff with an easy way to retrieve a list of unfulfillable holds, and perform actions on them to move them out of their hopeless condition.
