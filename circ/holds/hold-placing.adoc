Placing Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holds can be placed by staff on the Staff Client and by patrons on the OPAC. In this chapter we demonstrate placing holds on the Staff Client. See *Part IV, “OPAC”* for placing holds on the OPAC.

Hold Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen has four different levels of holds. Library staff can place holds at all four levels, while patrons can only place Meta-record,Title-level, and Volume-level holds.

The chart below summarizes the four levels of holds.

Title Level Hold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. To place a title level hold, retrieve the title record on the catalogue and click the _Place Hold_ button to the right of the record on the search result list, or record summary screen.
. Scan or type patron’s barcode into _Place hold for patron by barcode_, and then tab or move the cursor out of the box.
. Edit patron hold notification methods and pickup location, if necessary, and click _Submit_.
. Click _Continue_, or _Cancel_ if the hold failed, to go back to search result.

TIP: In step 2, checking the Place this hold for me radio button will set the login staff as the hold requester. If this is your personal account, you can use this button to place holds for yourself.

TIP: A default hold expiration date will be recorded if the libary has set up a default holds expiration period in their library settings. See *Chapter 49, Local Administration Menu*. Uncaptured holds will not be targeted after expiration date. To view and edit the expiration date, go to _Holds_ under _My Account_.

Meta-record Level Hold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways of placing meta-record holds:

Using _Advanced Holds Options_ button

. To place a Meta-record level hold, do a regular search for the title. Click _Place Hold_ link on either the result list or record details screen, shown as step 1 in *the section called “Title Level Hold”*.
. Click _Advanced Holds Options_ under the title.
. Scan patron's barcode. Select the acceptable format(s) and language(s). Edit patron hold notification methods and/or pickup location, if required. Click _Submit_ button.

Using _Group by Formats and Editions_ Search

. Search for the meta-record on which you want to place a hold. On the _Advanced Search_ screen, select the _Group by Formats and Editions_ checkbox. Select the search type and type in search terms. Click _Search_.
. Click _Place Hold_ beside the the meta-record on the result list.
TIP: The icons indicate the available formats at the search location. The number in the parenthsis beside the title indicates the number of records with physical items. Click the title to view these records. Meta-record holds do not cover E-resources. But E-resource icons may be displayed if the search location owns matched E-resources. The link(s) will show up only when the search location and/or the preferred library of the login account is a library or branch and owns the E-resource. Click the link(s) in the summary to access these E-resource records.
. Type in or scan the patron barcode at the prompt.
. Select the acceptable formats. Use the _CTRL_ key together with a mouse click to select multiple entries. Click _Submit_ once done.

TIP: If no format is selected. All available formats are targeting candadites.  
Format information is from the MARC record leader and fixed fields. Requested formats are listed in the Holdable Formats column in hold records. Use the Column Picker to display it. Once a new Web-browser-based staff client is used, format icons would be displayed in this column. Right now you will see a string. Look for the language/format codes, such as "eng", "fre", "book", "dvd", "blue-ray", etc. All the selected formats in any of the selected language(s) are targeting candidates.
After a meta-record hold is placed, if a new MARC record is added and it meets the grouping criteria (title, author and format), items under this new record will be used to fulfill the existing holds.

Volume Level Hold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. To place a volume level hold, retrieve and display the record.
. On the holdings grid, click _Volume_ in _HOLDABLE?_ column in the row of your chosen volume.
. Scan or type patron’s barcode into _Place hold for patron by barcode_.
. Edit patron hold notification fields as required and click _Submit_. Note the hold is identified as a _Volume Hold_.

Copy Level Hold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Retrieve and display the record.
. On the holdings grid, click _Copy_ in _HOLDABLE?_ column in the row of your chosen copy.
. Scan or type patron’s barcode into _Place hold for patron by barcode_.
. Edit patron hold notification fields as required and click _Submit_. Note the hold is identified as a _Copy Hold_.

Placing Holds in Patron Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Holds can be placed from patron records too. In the patron record _Holds_ screen, click the _Place Hold_ button on the left top corner.
. The catalogue is displayed in the _Holds_ screen.
. Search for the title and place holds using the same procedure as placing holds directly in the catalogue.
