Placing Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holds can be placed by staff in the web client,  and by patrons on your public catalogue.

Hold Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen has four different holds levels. Library staff can place holds at all four levels, while patrons can only place meta-record, title-level, and volume-level holds.
