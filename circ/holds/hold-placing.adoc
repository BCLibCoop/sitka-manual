[NOTE]
======
When the library setting _Randomize group hold order_ is set to TRUE Evergreen will randomize the patrons 
in the group when the holds are placed so the same patron isn't always first in line.

Hold Placement Status Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When placing a hold in the staff client library staff may see the following messages in the _Holds
Status_ column:

*Hold Pending* - Evergreen is waiting for the hold to be placed.

*Hold Succeeded* - The hold has successfully been placed for the patron.

*HIGH_LEVEL_HOLD_HAS_NO_COPIES* - This indicates that there are no holdable items that can fill the hold.

*ITEM_AGE_PROTECTED* - This indicates that the item is under age-based hold protection set through the 
xref:_item_attributes[items attributes] and cannot currently fill holds at your library.  If you 
override and place the hold it will eventually be filled when the item is no longer protected.

*ITEM_NOT_HOLDABLE* - This indicates that the item is under age-based hold protection set through the Hold
Policies and cannot currently fill holds at your library.  If you override and place the hold it 
will eventually be filled when the item is no longer protected.

The following messages indicate that the patron's account has a system or staff generated block on it 
preventing holds from being placed.  The thresholds for staff generated blocks are determined
by your xref:_group_penalty_thresholds[group penalty thresholds].

*PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES* - This indicates that the patron has a system generated block because they have
exceeded your fine threshold.  

*PATRON_EXCEEDS_OVERDUE_COUNT* - This indicates that the patron has a system generated block because
they have exceeded your overdue item threshold. 

*PATRON_EXCEEDS_LOST_COUNT* - This indicates that the patron has a system generated block because
they have exceeded your lost item threshold.  

*STAFF_CHR* - This indicates that the patron has had a manual block placed on their account by staff.  

Staff with appropriate permissions can choose to override these blocks and place the hold.
