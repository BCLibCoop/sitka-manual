Holds can be placed by staff in the web client,  and by patrons on your public catalogue.

Hold Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen has four different holds levels. Library staff can place holds at all four levels, while patrons can only place meta-record, title-level, and volume-level holds.

The chart below summarizes the four levels of holds.

Meta-record Level Hold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can request acceptable formats and languages of a title at time of hold placement, or you can group formats at time of search. Records are grouped by title, author, and format. Format information is from the MARC record leader and fixed fields.
