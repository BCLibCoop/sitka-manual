Working with Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic Hold Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. A hold is placed by the patron or by library staff on behalf of the patron
. Library staff capture the hold.  This can happen when an item on hold is returned and checked in or 
when staff pull and check in available items listed on the xref:_pull_list_for_hold_requests[pull list].
. The patron is notified automatically by text or email, or manually by staff
. The item is placed on the xref:_holds_shelf[hold shelf].
. The hold is complete when the patron checks out or cancels their hold or when staff cancel or 
clear the hold.

Is it Holdable?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of factors determine whether or not a hold can be placed.

* The status of the item
** Some xref:_item_statuses[item statuses] are not holdable
* How the item is catalogued
** xref:_creating_a_shelving_location[Shelving locations] can be set to Holdable = NO
** xref:_item_attributes[Items] can be set to Holdable = NO
* The library's xref:_hold_policies[hold policies] can block holds based on:
** Patron types
** Circulation modifiers
** Owning/Pickup library
** Age hold protection
* The library setting _Has Local Copy Block_
** When this is set to TRUE holds cannot be placed on available items

Age Based Hold Protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Age based hold protection enables libraries to block holds from being filled for patrons from other 
libraries or branches until the item has been active for a specified amount of time.  

Age based hold protection can be set up as part of your xref:_hold_policies[hold policies] or can be 
applied an a per item basis via xref:xref:_item_attributes[item attributes].  Your library can do 
age based hold protection via hold policies OR via item attribute; you cannot use both at the same time.

Make sure you know if and how your library does age based hold proection.
