Working with Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic Hold Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. A hold is placed by the patron or by library staff on behalf of the patron
. Library staff capture the hold.  This can happen when an item on hold is returned and checked in or 
when staff pull and check in available items listed on the xref:_pull_list_for_hold_requests[pull list].
. The patron is notified automatically by text or email, or manually by staff
. The item is placed on the xref:_holds_shelf[hold shelf].
. The hold is complete when the patron checks out or cancels their hold or when staff cancel or 
clear the hold.

Is it Holdable?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of factors determine whether or not a hold can be placed.

* The status of the item
** Some xref:_item_statuses[item statuses] are not holdable
* How the item is catalogued
** xref:_creating_a_shelving_location[Shelving locations] can be set to Holdable = NO
** xref:_item_attributes[Items] can be set to Holdable = NO
* The library's xref:_hold_policies[hold policies] can block holds based on:
** Patron types
** Circulation modifiers
** Owning/Pickup library
** Age based hold protection
** Maximum number of holds allowed at a time
* The library setting _Has Local Copy Block_
** When this is set to TRUE holds cannot be placed on available items

Individual patrons can also be blocked from placing holds due to exceeding 
xref:_group_penalty_thresholds[group penalty thresholds].

Hold Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen has four different holds levels. Library staff can place holds at all four levels, while 
patrons can only place meta-record, title level, and call number level holds.

|===
|Hold level |	Abbreviation |	When to use	How to use|	Who can use |Hold tied to
|xref:_placing_meta_record_level_holds[Meta-record]| M	|Patron wants first available copy of multiple titles of the same/different format.	Click on place hold to the right of the record. From holds confirmation screen, click Advanced hold options and select other applicable formats. |Patron or staff |	Holdings attached to multiple MARC (title) records sharing the same title and author of selected format(s)(book, video, audiobook, etc.)
|xref:_placing_title_level_holds[Title]	| T	| Patron wants first available copy of a title.	Staff or patron click on place hold to the right 
of a record on search result list or record summary screen. *Libraries participating in Interlibrary Connect 
should use title level holds for ILC holds.* | Patron or staff | Holdings attached to a single MARC (title) record
|xref:_placing_call_number_and_item_level_holds[Call Number]	| V	| Patron wants the first available copy of a specific call number of a title. Staff 
click *Call Number Hold* in *Holdable?* column on the record summary screen.	| Patron or staff | 
Call number record
|xref:_placing_call_number_and_item_level_holds[Item]	| C | Patron or staff want a specific copy of a title.  Staff click *Item hold* in *Holdable?* 
column on the record summary screen.	| Staff	| Item barcode

Hold Statuses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Holds will have one of the following statuses:

[options="header"]
|===
|Status |Description
|Cancelled | The hold has been cancelled.  Staff need to check the item in to return it to circulation or capture
the next hold.
|In Transit | The item is in transit to the pickup library from another library.
|Ready for Pickup | The item is on the holds shelf and ready for pick up.  The status of the item will show
as _On Holds Shelf_.
|Reserved/Pending | The hold has been captured and has not been put on the holds shelf. The status will be 
automatically changed to _Ready for Pickup_ once the delay period specified in library setting  
_Hold Shelf Status Delay_.
|Suspended | The hold is suspended and will not be filled until it is automatically or manually activated.
|Waiting for Capture | An available item has been assigned to the hold but it hasn't been captured
for the hold yet.  The item will display on the 
xref:_pull_list_for_hold_requests[_Pull List for Hold Requests_]. 
|Waiting for Item | All holdable item are currently checked out or otherwise not available.
|Wrong Shelf | The pickup library for the hold has changed.  Staff need to check the item in to send it
into transit to the new pickup library.

Age Based Hold Protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Age Based Hold Protection)))

Age based hold protection enables libraries to block holds from being filled for patrons from other 
libraries or branches until the item has been active for a specified amount of time.  

Age based hold protection can be set up as part of your xref:_hold_policies[hold policies] or can be 
applied on a per item basis via xref:xref:_item_attributes[item attributes].  Protection via hold policies
will apply to holds on all items or holds using specified circulation modifiers.  Protection via item
attributes is applied by cataloguers on an item by item basis.

Single branch libraries can use age based hold protection via hold policies OR via item attribute; you 
should not use both at the same time.  Multi-branch libraries can use a combination of age based hold 
protection through hold policies AND item attributes to control hold filling between their branches and 
other libraries.

Make sure you know if and how your library does age based hold protection.
