Re-targeting Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Re-Target Holds)))
(((Holds, Re-Target Holds)))

Newly created items, or items whose status was just changed from a non-holdable to a holdable status, may not trigger holds on regular check-in because these copies are not yet identified as hold targets. The holds targeter will eventually target such holds overnight, or you can re-target them immediately. Re-targeting a hold means Evergreen searches for an available copy for the hold right away, and puts it on the *Holds Pull List* if found. If there is no available copy, the hold's status will be set to *Wait for copy*.

You can re-target local holds at check-in by use of *Checkin Modifiers*, or you can manually re-target holds from title, patron, or hold record as follows.


. Select the hold from any hold management screen and click *Actions -> Find Another Target*.

TIP:  Co-op Support recommends multi-branch libraries use *Find Another Target*, as described above, in order to re-target all holds in the system. For single branch libraries, Co-op Support recommends the check-in modifiers *Retarget Local Holds* and *Retarget All Statuses* be enabled. These check-in modifiers are sticky.
