Items are captured for holds at check in either opportunistically when an item is returned by a patron
or deliberately when items on the _Pull List for Hold Requests_ are pulled and checked in.  

Multi-branch libraries and libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing will see both holds and 
hold transits captured at check in.

[NOTE]
======
When the Checkin Modifer _Auto-Print Hold and Transit Slips_ is enabled hold and hold transit slips
will print automatically without displaying a slip pop up within Evergreen.

Capturing Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. When a hold is captured at check in staff will see a hold slip pop up or the hold slip will automatically
print depending on whether or not auto-printing is enabled.
. The method being used to notify the patron will display on the hold slip and is included on
the printed slip by default.

+
Libraries can customize their hold slips to limit the amount of patron personal information that is 
printed.
+
. If the patron chose to be notified by email or SMS text message Evergreen will automatically 
xref: _hold_ready_for_pickup[send the notification] after the notification processing delay has passed.
+
If the patron chose to be notified by phone library staff need to call the patron.
+
. Once the patron has been notified the item should go on the library's hold shelf.


Go to *Circulation â†’ Check In*.

. Scan or enter the barcode and click *Submit*.
. The item is checked in and the hold is captured.
. If auto-printing is enabled, the hold transit slip or hold slip will automatically print. Otherwise, a 
hold transit or hold slip pop up will appear.
.. For holds, the pop up will indicate what method is being used to contact the patron.  This information
is also available on the printed slip by default.

Capturing Hold Transits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. When a hold transit is captured at check in staff will see a hold transit slip pop up or 
the hold transit slip will automatically print depending on whether or not auto-printing is enabled.

.. For hold transits, the pop up will indicate what location the item needs to be sent to. This 
information is also available on the printed slip by default.

. 
. Put the item on your hold shelf or ship it to the hold's pick up library.


[CAUTION]
=========
Hold notifications have processing delays.  The email notification delay can be customized by the library. The
SMS text message delay is set globally at 30 minutes and cannot be customized.

If a hold is checked out to the patron during the processing delay the notification will not be sent as 
Evergreen no longer considers it to be relevant.
=========


[NOTE]
======
A patron's contact information on the hold slip may differ from what is in their patron account.  Patrons have 
the option to enter different notification information when placing a hold.  Evergreen will use the 
information saved in the hold record when notifiying patrons.
