Items are captured for holds at check in either opportunistically when an item is returned by a patron
or deliberately when items on the _Pull List for Hold Requests_ are pulled and checked in.  

Multi-branch libraries and libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing will see both holds and 
hold transits captured at check in.

[NOTE]
======
When the Checkin Modifer _Auto-Print Hold and Transit Slips_ is enabled hold and hold transit slips
will print automatically without displaying a slip pop up within Evergreen.
======

Capturing Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. When a hold is captured at check in staff a hold slip pop up will appear, unless 
auto-printing is enabled.
. Staff can click *Print* or *Do Not Print* depending on their needs.

+
. The item is checked in and the item status is updated to _On Holds Shelf_.
. The patron will be notified automatically by Evergreen or by library staff depending on the method
chosen for notification when the hold was placed. The chosen method will display on the hold slip and 
is included on the printed slip by default.

[CAUTION]
=========
Do NOT check out the item to the patron until after the notification processing delay has
past or Evergreen will NOT send the automatic notification.  For information on hold notification
processing delays see xref:_hold_ready_for_pickup[].
=========
. The item is placed on the library's xref:_holds_shelf[hold shelf].

[NOTE]
======
Libraries with self pickup hold shelfs can customize the hold slip to limit the amount of patron 
personal information that is printed.
======


Capturing Hold Transits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. When a hold transit is captured at check in staff will see a hold transit slip pop up or 
the hold transit slip will automatically print depending on whether or not auto-printing is enabled.

.. For hold transits, the pop up will indicate what location the item needs to be sent to. This 
information is also available on the printed slip by default.

. 
. Put the item on your hold shelf or ship it to the hold's pick up library.

[NOTE]
======
A patron's contact information on the hold slip may differ from what is in their patron account.  Patrons have 
the option to enter different notification information when placing a hold.  Evergreen will use the 
information saved in the hold record when notifiying patrons.
