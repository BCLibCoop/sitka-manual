Capturing Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Holds)))
(((Holds, Capture Holds)))

Holds are captured when a checked-out item is checked-in, or an item on the *Holds Pull List* is retrieved and captured. When a hold is captured, the hold slip will be printed, unless disabled, and if the patron has chosen to be notified by email, the email notification will be sent out.

. Select *Circulation → Capture Holds* or *Circulation → Check In*.
. Scan or enter barcode and click *Submit*.
. Patron contact information and any routing information for the hold is captured.
. The hold or hold transit slip is automatically printed on *Hold Capture* screen by default.
. On *Check In* screen, select *Checkin Modifiers → Auto-Print Hold and Transit Slips* to print hold slips automatically.


TIP: Patron contact information on the slip may differ from what is in their patron account record. Patrons have the option to enter different information when placing a hold, and Evergreen will print information from the hold record, rather than from the patron record.
