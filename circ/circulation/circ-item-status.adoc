Upload from File (Choose file)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can upload a .csv file of multiple barcodes using the *Choose File* option. To ensure smooth uploading 
and further processing of the items, it is recommended that the list contain no more than 100 items.

. Run a report in Evergreen to list the items you'd like to load into _Item Status_.
. Open the report in a program like Excel and remove all columns other than the barcode column, remove the 
header row, and save the file as a .csv file.  
. In Evergreen, open _Item Status_.
. Click *Choose File*.
