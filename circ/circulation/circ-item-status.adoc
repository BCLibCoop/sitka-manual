The _Item Status_ screen is very useful to circulators and cataloguers at your library. Scanning a barcode 
into _Item Status_ does not affect the item's current status. 

To access _Item Status _ select  *Cataloguing -> Item Status* or *Circulation -> Item Status*.  By default
the _List View_ will open.


The _List View_ allows staff to view information for multiple items at a glance as well as performing many
actions on select items via the *Actions* menu.

The _Detail View_ allows staff to a variety of information about a specific item using the different tabs.

Clicking on the item's title either either the _List View_ or _Detail View_ will open the record in the 
staff catalogue.


Upload from File (Choose file)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can upload a .csv file of multiple barcodes using the *Choose File* option. To ensure smooth uploading 
and further processing of the items, it is recommended that the list contain no more than 100 items.

. Run a report in Evergreen to list the items you'd like to load into _Item Status_.
. Open the report in a program like Excel and remove all columns other than the barcode column, remove the 
header row, and save the file as a .csv file.  
. In Evergreen, open _Item Status_.
. Click *Choose File*.
