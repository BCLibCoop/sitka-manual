Renewal and Edit Due Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Renewal)))
Checked-out items can be renewed if your library's policy allows it. The new due date is calculated from the renewal date. Existing loans can also be extended to a specific date by renewing with a specific due date, or editing the due date.

Renewal
^^^^^^^
. Click *Items Out* tab in patron account.
. Select the items and click *Actions*.
. Select, *Renew*, *Renew All*, or *Renew With Specific Due Date*.

TIP: You can also renew items on the *Item Status* screen.

Edit Due Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: *Edit Due Date* changes the due date in the existing circulation record without reducing remaining renewals, or creating a new circulation record. It does not generate new circulation statistics, and no new notices are generated. For example, editing the due date will not generate a new pre-due notice near the new due date. Co-op Support strongly recommends you use *Renew With Specific Due Date* rather than manually edit a due date.
