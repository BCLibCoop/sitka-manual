Renewing Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Renewal)))

Checked-out items can be renewed if your library's policy allows it. The new due date is calculated from the renewal date. Existing loans can also be extended to a specific date by renewing with a specific due date, or editing the due date.

TIP: You can also renew items on the *Item Status* screen.

NOTE: It is not currently possible to select a specific due date time when renewing hourly loans with 
*Renew With Specific Due Date*.  For now the *Edit Due Date* function should be used if a specific time
is required.

NOTE: *Edit Due Date* changes the due date in the existing circulation record without reducing 
remaining renewals, or creating a new circulation record. It does not generate new 
circulation statistics, and no new notices are generated. For example, editing the due date 
will not generate a new pre-due notice near the new due date. Co-op Support strongly recommends 
you use *Renew With Specific Due Date* rather than manually edit a due date unless you are working with
hourly loans.
