Renewing Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Renewal)))


Items that are checked out can be manually renewed by staff or by patrons. The new due date is calculated 
from the renewal date unless a specific due date is specified.  The number of renewals allowed for a 
circulation is determined by the library's circulation policy.

Evergreen can also be set up to auto-renew items when they reach their due date.  Items will not be
automatically renewed if the item has holds, exceeds the maximum number of auto-renewals allowed, 
or if the patron has been blocked from renewing items.  An xref:_autorenew_notification[email notification]
is sent to patrons to inform them of the renewal or if the item could not be renewed.

[TIP]
=====
You can also renew items on the *Item Status* screen.

[NOTE]
======
It is not currently possible to select a specific due date time when renewing hourly loans with 
*Renew With Specific Due Date*.  For now the *Edit Due Date* function should be used if a specific time
is required.
======

Exceptions at Renewal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An item can be blocked from renewing for the following reasons:

* Patron has a xref:_patron_notes[system generated or staff generated block] on their account.
* The item has no more renewals allowed as per the library's xref:_circulation_policies[circulation policies].
* The item is needed to fill a hold.

.To override an exception when renewing:
. Check or un-check the box for *Automatically override for subsequent items* as applicable to the check out.
. Click *Force Action?*. Staff must have the xref:_staff_account_permission_groups[appropriate permissions]
 to force the check out.
+

. The item will be updated in the grid. The new due date will be determined by your 
xref:_circulation_policies[circulation policies].

Edit Due Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Due Date, Edit)))


. Click the *Items Out* tab in the patron account.
. Select the items and click *Actions*.
. Select, *Edit Due Date*.
. Select the new due date and due date time (if working with hourly loans).
+

NOTE: *Edit Due Date* changes the due date in the existing circulation record without reducing 
remaining renewals, or creating a new circulation record. It does not generate new 
circulation statistics, and no new notices are generated. For example, editing the due date 
will not generate a new pre-due notice near the new due date. Co-op Support strongly recommends 
you use *Renew With Specific Due Date* rather than manually edit a due date unless you are working with
hourly loans.

Auto Renewals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Circulation policies in Evergreen can now be configured to automatically renew items checked out on patron 
accounts. Circulations will be renewed automatically and an xref:_autorenew_notification[email notification]
sent to patrons to inform them of the renewal or if the item could not be renewed.  Patrons will not need 
to log in to their accounts or ask library staff to renew materials.

Autorenewals are set in the *Circulation Duration Rules*, which allows this feature to be applied to selected 
circulation policies. Effectively, this makes autorenewals configurable by patron group, organizational unit 
or library, and circulation modifier.

Configure Autorenewals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Autorenewals are configured by Co-op Support. Please contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if you would like to enable Autorenewals.

* max_auto_renewals is the allowed number of automatic renewals.
* max_renewals is the allowed number of manual renewals, whether staff or patron initiated.

The Circulation Duration Rule is then applied to specific circulation policies (Administration → 
Local Administration → Circulation Policies) to implement autorenewals in Evergreen.

[NOTE]
======
Autorenewals will not occur if the item has holds, exceeds the maximum number of autorenewals allowed, 
or if the patron has been blocked from renewing items.
======

Autorenewals in Patron Accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new column called AutoRenewalsRemaining indicates how many autorenewals are available for a transaction.

Checked-out items can be renewed if your library's policy allows it. The new due date is calculated from the renewal date. Existing loans can also be extended to a specific date by renewing with a specific due date, or editing the due date.
