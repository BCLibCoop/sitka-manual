[NOTE]
======
Evergreen can also automatically mark an item as lost after the item is a set number of days overdue.
See xref:_overdue_mark_lost_notification[] for information on this process.
======

A lost item is resolved when it is checked in or paid for.  A checked in lost item will continue
to display on a patron's  _Other/Special Circulations_ tab until all bills linked to the item are
resolved.  This includes replacement charges, overdue charges, and manual charges added to the existing bills. 
See Billing for more information on managing *Lost* bills.

There are a number of library settings which determine how Evergreen handles lost items:


When a lost item is found and returned, your library may choose to:

* Always void lost charges.

* Void lost charges if the item is returned within a specified time period, e.g. within 6 months since the due date.

* Generate a refund if payment has been made.

* Generate a refund only if the item is returned within a specified time period since the payment date.

* Restore existing overdue fines.

* Generate new overdue fines based on the check in date.
