[NOTE]
======
Evergreen can also automatically mark an item as lost after the item is a set number of days overdue.
See xref:_overdue_mark_lost_notification[] for information on this process.
======

A lost item is resolved when it is checked in or paid for.  A checked in lost item will continue
to display on a patron's  _Other/Special Circulations_ tab until all bills linked to the item are
resolved.  This includes replacement charges, overdue charges, and manual charges added to the existing bills. 
See Billing for more information on managing *Lost* bills.

There are a number of library settings which determine how Evergreen handles lost items:


When a lost item is found and returned, your library may choose to:

* Always void lost charges.

* Void lost charges if the item is returned within a specified time period, e.g. within 6 months since the due date.

* Generate a refund if payment has been made.

* Generate a refund only if the item is returned within a specified time period since the payment date.

* Restore existing overdue fines.

* Generate new overdue fines based on the check in date.

Claims Returned
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a patron believes an item out on their account was returned and staff cannot locate it to check it in
the item can be marked as Claims Returned. 

. Go to the _Items Out_ tab in the patron account.
. Select the item and click *Actions -> Mark Claims Returned*.
+

. Enter the date on which the patron claims they returned the item and click *Submit*.  If the due date is 
in the past any overdue fines will be adjusted accordingly.
+

+
. The item's status is updated to Claims Returned. It remains associated with the patron's account and is now displayed on the 
 _Other/Special Circulations_ tab.
+
[NOTE]
======
Some libraries prefer to use the status Missing.  This can be set using the library setting 
_Claim Return: Mark copy as missing_.
====== 
+

+
. The patron's *Claims-returned Count* is automatically increased. This can be viewed in the patron summary
and the _Edit_ tab.
+
[NOTE]
======
Libraries can use the library setting _Max Patron Claims Returned Count_ to set a maximum number of items
a patron can claim as returned before a staff override is required.
====== 

A claims returned items is resolved when it is checked in or when the status is updated to Missing or Lost
following local library policy.  An alert displays on check in to let staff know a claims returned
item has been found.  When an item is located staff may wish to adjust the patron's *Claims-returned Count*
accordingly on the _Edit_ tab.

Claims Never Checked Out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a patron believes an item was erroneously checked out on their account and staff cannot locate it 
to check it in the item can be marked as Claims Never Checked Out.

. Go to the _Items Out_ tab in the patron account.
. Select the item and click *Actions -> Mark Claims Never Checked Out*.

. A pop-up appears where staff can confirm that they wish to mark the item by click *OK/Continue*.
. The item is checked in and set to Missing. The item is no longer associated with the patron's account.

[Note]
======
Libraries may wish to routinely run reports on items with the status of Missing so they can be searched for
and replaced/deleted as appropriate.
