. A pop-up appears where staff can confirm that they wish to mark the item by clicking *OK/Continue*.
. The item is checked in and set to _Missing_. The item is no longer associated with the patron's account.

[Note]
======
Libraries may wish to routinely run reports on items with the status of _Missing_ so they can be searched for
and replaced/deleted as appropriate.
======

Claims Returned
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

the item can be marked as claims returned.

image:images/circ/mark-claims-returned-2.png[]
+
. The item's status is updated to _Claimed Returned_. It remains associated with the patron's account and 
is now displayed on the _Other/Special Circulations_ tab.
+
[NOTE]
======
Some libraries prefer to use the status _Missing_.  This can be set using the library setting 
_Claim Return: Mark copy as missing_.
====== 
+
image:images/circ/mark-claims-returned-3.png[]
+
. The patron's *Claims-returned Count* is automatically increased. This can be viewed in the patron summary
and the _Edit_ tab.
+
[NOTE]
======
Libraries can use the library setting _Max Patron Claims Returned Count_ to set a maximum number of items
a patron can claim as returned before a staff override is required.
====== 

A claimed returned items is resolved when it is checked in or when the status is updated to _Missing_ or _Lost_
following local library policy.  An alert displays on check in to let staff know a claimed returned
item has been found.  When an item is located staff may wish to adjust the patron's *Claims-returned Count*
accordingly on the _Edit_ tab.

Damaged
^^^^^^^
If a patron damages an item it can be marked as damaged at check in, via the Item Status interface, or
from within a patron's account.

pop-up will appear.
.. If needed, adjust the amount being billed.
.. Select the bill type from the drop down menu.

+
. The item's status is updated to _Damaged_ and removed from the patron's account. If the patron has

A damaged item is resolved when it is checked in to return it to circulation, when the status is updated to 
_Discard/Weed_, or when the item is deleted.  An alert displays on check in to let staff know a damaged
item has been checked in.

[NOTE]
======
Checking in a damaged item does not affect any bills that were generated when the item was set to _Damaged_.
======

Discard/Weed
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an item is slated to be removed from the collection it can be marked as discard/weed at check in
or via the Item Status interface.  Libraries may wish to use the _Discard/Weed_ status when items to be
discarded need to be reviewed before being deleted.

and work with the items.  See xref:cat-copy-bucket[] for information on using item buckets. 
======

in the item.

account.

A missing item is resolved when it is found and checked in or when it is deleted from Evergreen.

Missing Pieces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an item is returned with pieces missing it can be marked as missing pieces from Check In or
the Scan Item as Missing Pieces interface. The feature currently functions slightly different depending
on which interface it is accessed through.

Mark Missing Pieces via Check In
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

. Go to *Circulation -> Check In*.
. Check the item in.
. Select the item and click *Actions -> Mark Missing Pieces*.
+
image:images/circ/mark-missing-pieces-1.png[]
+
. A pop-up appears where staff can confirm that they wish to mark the item by clicking *OK/Continue*.
+
. A print dialog will appear.  Staff can print the slip to keep with the item.
. The xref:_staff_generated_notes[_Create Note_] pop-up will appear.  Use the pop-up to create a note, 
alert, or block on the patron's account.  This note can be set as patron visible so it displays to the 
patron in My Account.
. Click *OK*.
. The note is applied to the last borrower's account and the item is set to _Damaged_ and checked back out
to the patron's account.
+
[NOTE]
======
This method of setting an item as missing pieces is missing the letter that is generated at the end of the 
process.  If that letter is important to your workflow you should always mark items missing pieces
via the Scan Item as Missing Pieces interface.
======

Scan Item as Missing Pieces
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

. Go to *Circulation -> Scan Item as Missing Pieces*.
. Scan the item's barcode.
. Click *Mark Item as Missing Pieces?*.
+
image:images/circ/mark-missing-pieces-2.png[]
+
. A print dialog will appear.  Staff can print the slip to keep with the item.
. The xref:_staff_generated_notes[_Create Note_] pop-up will appear.  Use the pop-up to create a note, 
alert, or block on the patron's account.  
+
[NOTE]
======
This pop-up is the old Notes pop-up and is missing the functionality that allows staff to select the display
depth and set a note as patron visible so it displays to the patron in My Account.
======
+
. Click *OK*.
. The note is applied to the last borrower's account and the item is set to _Damaged_ and renewed on the
patron's account, if there are remaining renewals.
. A letter is generated that can be edited and then printed and mailed to the patron.
+
image:images/circ/mark-missing-pieces-3.png[]

A missing pieces item is resolved when the pieces are returned and the item is checked in or the pieces 
are never returned and the item is deleted.  Notes related to the item must be manually removed from
the patron's account.

[NOTE]
======
Libraries can choose to use a different item status for missing pieces instead of _Damaged_.  The 
library setting _Item Status for Missing Pieces_ is used to set this.
======

Lost
^^^^

If a patron loses an item, it can be marked as lost in their account.

. Go to the _Items Out_ tab in the patron account.
. Select the item and click *Actions -> Mark Lost (By Patron)*.
+
image:images/circ/mark-lost-1.png[]
+
. The item's status is updated to _Lost_. It remains associated with the patron's account and is now 
displayed on the _Other/Special Circulations_ tab.
+
image:images/circ/mark-lost-2.png[]
+
. A bill is automatically added to the patron's account on the _Bills_ tab for the replacement cost of 
the item and displays in dark red. A processing fee is included if the library has a value in the 
library setting _Lost Materials Processing Fee_.
+
image:images/circ/mark-lost-3.png[]

[NOTE]
======
Evergreen can also automatically mark an item as lost after the item is a set number of days overdue.
See xref:_overdue_mark_lost_notification[] for information on this process.
======

A lost item is resolved when it is checked in or paid for.  A checked in lost item will continue
to display on a patron's  _Other/Special Circulations_ tab until all bills linked to the item are
resolved.  This includes replacement charges, overdue charges, and manual charges added to the existing bills. 
See xref:_bills_and_payments[] for more information on managing *Lost* bills.

////
There are a number of library settings which determine how Evergreen handles lost items:

* Lost Materials Processing Fee
* Charge lost on zero
* Default Item Price

* Lost items usable on checkin

* Void overdue fines when items are marked lost
* Restore overdues on lost item return
* Lost Checkin Generates New Overdues

* Void lost max interval

* Void lost item billing when claims returned
* Void lost item processing fee when claims returned
* Void lost item billing when returned
* Void processing fee on lost item return

* Negative Balance Interval for Lost
* Prohibit negative balance on bills for lost materials


When a lost item is found and returned, your library may choose to:

* Always void lost charges.

* Void lost charges if the item is returned within a specified time period, e.g. within 6 months since the due date.

* Generate a refund if payment has been made.

* Generate a refund only if the item is returned within a specified time period since the payment date.

* Restore existing overdue fines.

* Generate new overdue fines based on the check in date.
