In-House Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((In-house Use)))

In-house use can be recorded for catalogued and non-catalogued items. 

The library setting _Record In-House Use: # of uses thresholds for Are You Sure? dialog_ allows you to set a
threshold at which Evergreen will check that you really want to record that many in-house uses.  This can
be useful to prevent an accidental scan of a barcode in the _# of Uses_ from inflating in-house statistics.

The library setting _Record In-House Use: Maximum # of uses allowed per entry_ allows you to set a maxiumum
number of uses that can be resoced at a time.

[NOTE]
======
The statistics for in-house use are separate from regular circulation statistics. The in-house use 
count of catalogued items is not included in an item's total use count.

if you find items with a status other than _Available_ or _Reshelving_.
