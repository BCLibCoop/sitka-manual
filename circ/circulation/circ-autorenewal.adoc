Autorenew
^^^^^^^^^

Circulation policies in Evergreen can now be configured to automatically renew items checked out on patron 
accounts. Circulations will be renewed automatically and an xref:_autorenew_notification[email notification]
sent to patrons to inform them of the renewal or if the item could not be renewed.  Patrons will not need 
to log in to their accounts or ask library staff to renew materials.

Autorenewals are set in the *Circulation Duration Rules*, which allows this feature to be applied to selected 
circulation policies. Effectively, this makes autorenewals configurable by patron group, organizational unit 
or library, and circulation modifier.

Configure Autorenewals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Autorenewals are configured by Co-op Support. Please contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if you would like to enable Autorenewals.

* max_auto_renewals is the allowed number of automatic renewals.
* max_renewals is the allowed number of manual renewals, whether staff or patron initiated.

The Circulation Duration Rule is then applied to specific circulation policies (Administration → 
Local Administration → Circulation Policies) to implement autorenewals in Evergreen.

[NOTE]
======
Autorenewals will not occur if the item has holds, exceeds the maximum number of autorenewals allowed, 
or if the patron has been blocked from renewing items.

Autorenewals in Patron Accounts

A new column called AutoRenewalsRemaining indicates how many autorenewals are available for a transaction.
