Besides the regular items in the catalogue, Sitka's Evergreen can circulate pre-catalogued and non-catalogued items too.

* Regular circulation of items in your catalogue with a barcode.
* Pre-catalogued , or pre-cat, circulation of items that have a barcode but have not been catalogued yet. Pre-cat records are created on the fly in *Check Out* screen, and can not be searched in the catalogue; pre-cats can only be found in patron account or by barcode search.  Many Sitka sites use pre-cat functionality to circulate interlibrary loan items from other libraries. There is no need to route to cataloguing when using pre-cat for interlibrary loan, you can simply ignore the alert.
* Non-catalogued, or non-cat, circulation of items that are not in your catalogue and without a barcode.
