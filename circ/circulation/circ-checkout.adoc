Staff can click *OK/Continue* after reading the alert to proceed with check out.

Temporary alerts will have a *Clear* button which can be used to clear the alert when it is no longer needed.

Overriding at Check Out
+++++++++++++++++++++++

An item can be blocked from circulation for the following reasons:

* Patron has a xref:_patron_notes[system generated or staff generated block] on their account
* Item is in a non-circulating xref:_item_statuses[status]
* Item is in a non-circulating xref:_shelving_location_editor[shelving location]
* Item has been set to xref:_item_attributes[Circulate = No in the item record]
* Item has been set to xref:_items_with_deposits[Is Deposit Required = Yes in the item record]
* The library's xref:_circulation_policies[circulation policies] block the patron from borrowing the item
* Item is on the holds shelf for another patron

.To override an exception at check out:
. Check or un-check the box for *Automatically override for subsequent items* as applicable to the check out.
. Click *Force Action?*. Staff must have the xref:_staff_account_permission_groups[appropriate permissions]
 to force the check out.
+
image:images/circ/check-out-exceptions-1.png[scaledwidth="75%"]
+
. The item will appear below in the grid. The due date will be determined by your 
xref:_circulation_policies[circulation policies].

[NOTE]
======
Not all staff accounts can perform overrides.  Please see 
xref:_staff_account_permission_groups[] for a general outline of the different staff account
permission groups.
======

Open Circulation
++++++++++++++++

Occasionally a patron may try to check out an item that is already checked out.  This most commonly occurs 
with items that got missed at check in.  Staff have three options to 
resolve the open circulation:

* Click *Normal Checkin then Checkout* - this checks the item in and then out to the new patron
* Check the box for *Forgive Fines* and then click *Normal Checkin then Checkout* - this checks the item in, 
forgives any existing fines, and then checks the item out to the new patron
* Click *Cancel* - this cancels the check out and allows staff to manually resolve the open circulation

Sitka's Evergreen circulates catalogued, pre-catalogued, and non-catalogued items.

* Regular circulation of items in your catalogue with a barcode.
* Pre-catalogued , or pre-cat, circulation of items that have a barcode but have not been catalogued yet. Pre-cat records are created on the fly in *Check Out* screen, and can not be searched in the catalogue; pre-cats can only be found in patron account or by item barcode search.  Many Sitka sites use pre-cat functionality to circulate interlibrary loan items from other libraries. There is no need to route item to cataloguing when using pre-cat for interlibrary loan, you can simply ignore the alert.
* Non-catalogued, or non-cat, circulation of items that are not catalogued.

Regular Items
