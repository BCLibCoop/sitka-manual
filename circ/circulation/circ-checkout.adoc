Sitka's Evergreen circulates catalogued, pre-catalogued, and non-catalogued items.

* Regular circulation of items in your catalogue with a barcode.
* Pre-catalogued , or pre-cat, circulation of items that have a barcode but have not been catalogued yet. Pre-cat records are created on the fly in *Check Out* screen, and can not be searched in the catalogue; pre-cats can only be found in patron account or by item barcode search.  Many Sitka sites use pre-cat functionality to circulate interlibrary loan items from other libraries. There is no need to route item to cataloguing when using pre-cat for interlibrary loan, you can simply ignore the alert.
* Non-catalogued, or non-cat, circulation of items that are not catalogued.

NOTE: On check-in, Evergreen will prompt staff to re-route the item to cataloguing. This can be ignored if checking in an inter library loan item.

Non-catalogued Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Items are manually checked out with a due date but when the due date expires, the items disappear from the patron's record and no fines accrue. Circulation statistics are collected. Non-catalogued item types are library specific and are created locally

. Click on *Check Out Items*
. Click on the drop down arrow in *Barcode* to choose the type of non-catalogued items, and click *Submit*.

Due Dates
^^^^^^^^^
(((Check Out, Due Date Time)))

Due dates based on your circulation policies are calculated automatically at *Check Out*. 
Use *Date Options* to override the default due dates. You can choose to use a specific due date 
per session or continuously until log-out.


. Before you scan the item, click the drop down arrow in *Date Options*.
. Select  *Specific Due Date* or *Use Specific Due Date Until Logout*.
. Use the calendar widget or enter a date.  
.. For hourly loans use the time picker to select the due date time.  (Daily loans always have 
11:59pm/23:59pm as the due date time regardless of what is selected for due date time.)
. Scan the item barcode.
