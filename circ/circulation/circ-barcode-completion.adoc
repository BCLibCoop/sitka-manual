Barcode Completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Barcode Completion)))

It is best practice for libraries to use 14 digit codabar barcodes with their assigned prefix for items and 
patrons. Barcode completion can be used temporarily to handle duplication within Sitka's Evergreen while libraries re-barcode any items 
or patrons with non-14 digit codabar barcodes.  

Barcode completion can be turned on for items or patrons or both depending on a library's needs.

Registering Patrons with Barcode Completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases there are reaons why 14 digit codabar barcodes can't be used, such as student numbers issued by a registar's office.  
In those cases barcode completion to ensure unique barcodes are used within Sitka's Evergreen.

When creating new patrons, either from patron registration or by loading patron records, the prefix for barcode
completion must be included in the barcode for all non-14 digit codabar barcodes.


Circulation with Barcode Completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When barcode completion is turned on all non-14 digit codabar item and/or patron barcodes for the library 
will have a prefix included in the barcode in the database. See 
xref:_adding_holdings_when_barcode_completion_is_used[] for information on cataloguing with barcode completion.

. Scan a barcode into Check Out, Check In, or Item Status.
. If there is only one match Evergreen automatically adds the prefix and retrieves the 
appropriate item or patron.
. If there is a match a pop-up will appear listing the possible barcodes.

. Select the barcode that matches the patron or item.
. The patron will be retrieved or the item loaded on the screen.

Barcode completion is not currently available for My Account or the Evergreen self check-out.

3rd Party Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries that use barcode completion for patrons need to ensure that patrons know to include the prefix
when logging into 3rd party services that authenticate against Evergreen, such as Overdrive.

For example, Maple Public Library uses barcode completion with the prefix MPL.  The patron's barcode is 123456 
on their card and is MPL123456 in the Sitka database.  To log into their Overdrive account the patron 
must enter MPL123456.
