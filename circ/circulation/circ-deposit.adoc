Items with Deposits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((deposits)))

Libraries may have some items that require a deposit.  This may be
materials like special books that are hard to replace or items in a library of things collection
that are expensive to replace.

Items that require a deposit will have the _Is Deposit Required_ item attribute set to _Yes_ and
have an amount entered for the _Deposit Amount_ item attribute. 
See xref:_item_attributes[] for more information.

For libraries that refund the deposit when the item is returned the library setting 
_Void item deposit fee on checkin_ should be set to _TRUE_.
