(((Transit List)))

The *Transit List* report helps manage your incoming and outgoing transits. It is best practice to  pull transit lists when sending or receiving items from other branches or Sitka libraries. Reconciling the list against the physical items ensures your shipments are complete.

. Click *Administration -> Local Administration -> Transit List*.
. Select *Transits To* or *Transits From*  your library and specify *Start Date* and *End Date*.
