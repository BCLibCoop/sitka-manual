Evergreen’s *In Transit* feature is used to keep track of items transferring among branches 
within a library system or between separate Sitka libraries. It makes it easy for 
libraries to provide services such as allowing patrons to return items at any branch or 
Sitka library, or place holds on items belonging to another branch or library. Sitka services 
such as BC _ILC and SPRUCE ILL are possible because of Evergreen's *In Transit* functionality.

 Libraries should check the xref:_transit_list[Transit List] on a regular basis for items that 
 have been in transit longer than normal or have been put into transit by misscans.

. When an item is checked in at a non-owning branch or library, the status is changed to 
*In Transit* and a *Transit Slip* can be printed. Items in transit are sent to the destination 
branch or library according to your library’s policy and workflow.
. When you capture a hold with a pick-up library other than your branch or library, the item’s 
status is changed to *In Transit*. Holds in transit are sent to the destination branch or library 
according to your library’s policy and workflow.

TIP: If you capture holds on the *Capture Holds* screen, a *Transit/Hold* slip is printed 
automatically by default. If you capture holds on the *Check In* screen, you can choose to 
print slips automatically by selecting *Checkin Modifiers -> Auto-Print Hold and Transit Slips*.
