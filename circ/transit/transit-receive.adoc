* All items received from other branches or Sitka libraries must be checked in. Checking in updates an in transit item's status and its location.
* If it is your item coming back, its status changes to *Reshelving*, and its location is updated.
* If the item has a local hold on it, its status changes to *On Holds Shelf*,  its location is updated, and patron is notified.
* If the pickup branch for the hold is not your branch, the item is sent in transit again to the pickup branch.
