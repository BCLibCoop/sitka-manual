Cancel Transits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: Under certain circumstances cancelling a transit may be required, but it effectively cancels the previous check in. Cancelling a transit affects data integrity and the accuracy of circulation statistics. Co-op Support strongly recommends that only sending libraries ever cancel a transit, and only  before physically sending out items, while receiving libraries never cancel a transit, but check them in instead. This recommendation is a required work flow for libraries participating in BC_ILC and SPRUCE resource sharing agreements.
