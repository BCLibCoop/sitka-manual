The Evergreen Database
----------------------

When you use Evergreen you are creating and updating records within the Evergreen database.  Evergreen's
reporter enables you to create reports to extract those records from the database.  Understanding some
basics about the Evergreen database and how records are created and/or updated when tasks are performed on 
the staff client and public catalogue will help you when working with the reporter.
 
Various kinds of data are used by Evergreen to enable you to perform routine actions in Evergreen
such as checking out an item, registering a patron, or placing a hold. Data such as a patron names, address,
patron barcodes, item barcodes, shelving locations, statuses, item prices, check out dates, due dates,
check in dates, and more are saved in the Evergreen database. This data must be 
organized in an efficient and effective way to make sure it can be stored and retrieved easily.
 
Evergreen uses various tables to keep each type of records. You can visualize a table as a spreadsheet: a 
specified number of columns with unlimited number of rows. Each column is called a field in the 
database terminology and each row is a record. 

There are many tables in Evergreen's database. Each table contains a certain type of records and the 
information you see displayed on any interface is the staff client is likely coming
from more than one table. For example, in a patron account, you can find the patron's names, address,
phone number, barcode, main (profile) permission group, etc. all displaying as one record on 
the _Edit_ tab of the  patron's account.  However, in the database the patron's address, barcode, and 
main (profile) permission group are saved in separate tables. You don't need to know which tables the 
information is being pulled from when editing a patron record on the staff client, but you do need 
to know when creating a report template involving patron information.
 
Since various information about one patron is saved in separate tables, there has to be way to match 
the information about one patron correctly to make sure all the information is about the same patron. 
Evergreen does this by assigning each patron with a unique database ID and recording the database id 
in every related table. So by recording the ID of a record in another table, two tables are connected. 
Some database IDs, such as patron and bibliographic, are visible in the staff client, others can only
be seen within the database.

The connections among many tables are pre-made by the reporter. You just need to follow the link 
to find the data saved in the related table. Below is a simplified diagram showing the connections 
among some commonly used tables which can be a guide for you to find various fields in different tables.

[TIP]
=====
Some tables do not link directly with each other.  For example, there is not a direct link between the 
ILS User (patron) table and the item table.  Instead these tables link to each other via other tables 
such as the circulation table and the hold request table.
=====

The connections between tables are called joins. Evergreen uses the default join when creating
report templates which is usually what you need for a template.  When working with data that can
be null (have no value) you may need to use xref:_nullability[Nullability] which allows you 
to control the type of join used to link two tables.

To find out what the default join is for a table you can view the 
https://catalogue.libraries.coop/reports/fm_IDL.xml[fm_IDL.xml] file for Sitka's Evergreen.

. Search for the name of the source.
. Find the column you're interested in and take note of the vlaue for _Name_.
. Search the page for the _Name_ and look for it to appear in a <links> section.
. The reltype indicates the join.
+
"has_a" = inner join
+
"has_many" or "might_have" = left outer join

When you create a template you are writing a SQL (standard query language) query that will run on the Evergreen database.

This can be viewed in the report output by selecting *Debugging Info*.

Commonly Used Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[NOTE]
======
Some tables and fields in the database still use the term _copy_ while the preferred term _item_ is used
throughout the staff client.
======

////
A view is a virtual table which contains records meeting defined requirements. The fields in a view can 
be from one or more tables. Before you use a view for your report, you need to make sure the view contains 
the type of records that you want to report on. For example, Overdue Circulation is a view which contains 
circulation records without checkin date and the due date past "today". It does not work for a report on 
last month's circulation statistics, but it makes an overdue report easier.

here go to the _Bib Record_ table and then click on _Simple Records Extracts_.  Title, Author, ISBN,
ISSN, Publisher, Publication Year, and Record ID can be found in this table.

Bibliographic Record Table
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This table contains title information. In most cases you will want the basic bibliographic information
which is found within the _Simple Record Extract_ table.  When linking from other tables you usually have
to link through the _Call Number/Volume_ table to find the _Bib Record_ table.


Circulation Table
+++++++++++++++++

This table contains circulation records, including pre-catalogued item circulations. 

[NOTE]
======
When an item is checked out a circulation record is created. When an item is renewed the existing 
circulation record is closed and another circulation record is created.
====== 

Important date/time fields in this table include:
 
* Checkout Date/Time - the time when an item is checked out
* Checkin Date/Time - the effective date when the item is treated as checked in
* Checkin Scan Date/Time - the time when the check in action is taken
* Due Date/Time - For all daily loans the due time is 23:59:59 of the day in Pacific Time. Hourly loans have 
specific time with time zone information.
* Fine Stops Date/Time - the date when the Maximum Fine limit has been reached, or the item is returned, 
marked lost or claimed returned. After this date, the fine generator will not create new overdue 
fines for this circulation.

checkout it is the same as Checkout Date/Time. For offline checkout, this date is the offline 
transaction processing date.
* Transaction Finish Date/Time - the date when the bills linked to this checkout have been resolved. For a 
regular checkout without bills this field is filled with the checkin time when the item is returned.

the _Item Type_ table.

Hold Request Table
++++++++++++++++++

This table contains hold records for holds that are waiting to be filled or waiting to be picked up.

For patron information follow the link to the _Hold User_ table.

For information on who placed to hold follow the link to the _Requesting User_ table.  The requesting
user will either be the patron or a staff member if they placed the hold for the patron.

For information on the items that can be used to fill a hold follow the link to the _Hold Copy Map_.
Outside of the reporter this is refered to as the Eligible Copies table.

[TIP]
======
Target Object ID is shown as a link but there is no linked table in the Source pane. Depending on the 
type of hold the value in this field could be a bibliographic record ID, a call number record id or 
an item record ID.  This is one of the rare cases where you would select a link field to use for your
display field.
======

Important date/time fields in this table include:

* Activation Date - the date on which a suspended hold will be activated
* Capture Date/Time - the time when the hold is captured for the hold shelf or sent into transit
* Fulfillment Date/Time - the time when the on hold item is checked out

Hold Expire Interval or a selected date when placing the hold
* Last Targeting Date/Time - the last time the hold targeting program checked for an item to fill the hold. 
Usually the time will match the Hold Request Time as the hold targeter will generally check every
24 hours.  It is usually not useful for reporting, but it can serve as an indicator of whether or not the 
request time has been edited.
* Request Date/Time - Usually this is when the hold is placed but it is editable on the staff client. So 
sometimes this may be the request time chosen by the staff
* Shelf Expire Time - the date is calculated based on the Shelf Time and your library's Default Hold Shelf

Commonly Used Tables and Views in Evergreen Database
----------------------------------------------------

You are creating/updating records when you work on Evergreen. Reporting means you extract some of these 
records from the database that meet your requirements. Understanding the Evergreen database and how records 
are created/updated when tasks are performed on the staff client, will help you when you create templates and 
set up reports on the Reports interface.
 
There are various kinds of data used by Evergreen, such as patron's names, address, barcode, item's barcode, 
shelving location, status, price; checkout date, returned date, fines and bills and so on. This data must be 
organized in an efficient and effective way to make sure they can be stored and retrieved easily.
 
Evergreen uses various tables to keep each type of records. You can visualize a table as an MS Excel 
Worksheet: a specified number of columns with unlimited number of rows. Each column is called a field in the 
database terminology and each row is a record. There are many tables in Evergreen database. Each contains a 
certain type of records. The fields in a record you see on the Staff Client may be from more than one tables. 
For example, in a patron record, you can find patron's names, address, phone number, barcode, profile, etc. 
all in one record. But in the database, patron's address, barcode, and profile are in separate tables. You do 
not need to know where these fields are from when editing a patron record on the Staff Client, but you have to 
know it when creating a template on the Reports interface.
 
Since various information about one patron is saved in separate tables, there must be a mechanism of matching 
the information about one patron correctly to make sure all information is about the same patron. This is done 
via recording the patron id (a unique number in the main patron record) in every related table. So via 
recording the id of a record in another table, two tables are connected. The connections among many tables are 
pre-made by the Reports interface. You just need to follow the link to find the data saved in the related 
table. Below is a simplified diagram showing the connections among some commonly used tables/views on the 
Reports interface, which can be a guide for you to find various fields in different tables. Some explanation 
of these tables is after the diagram.

image::images/report/database-1.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Database Diagram"]
 
Commonly used tables and views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*ILS User* (aka Patron or User): contains patron records. A patron's name, phone number, email address, and 
registration date can all be found in this table. Follow the links to the table Current Library Card to find 
a patron's current barcode, Circulation to find the circulation history, Home Library, Mailing Address, 
Physical Address, and Main Profile Group, etc. to find more information about the patron.
 
*Item* (aka Circulating Item): contains copy records. Item's barcode, creation date, active date, last edited 
date, last copy status change date and price are in this table. For related information like call number, 
circulating library, circ modifier, status, shelving location, etc., you need to follow the links to the 
respective table to find them. For title information you need to follow the Call Number table to the 
Bibliographic Record table to find it. Follow the link to the Circulation table to find an item's circulation 
history.
 
Pre-catalogued item information such as dummy ISBN, title and author are also in this table. When a 
pre-catalogued item is checked out, an item record is created. If the barcode is already in the table and 
the item is not marked deleted, the item record will be updated with the new title, author, etc.
 
*Bibliographic Record:* Contains title information. To find the basic bibliographic information such as title, 
author, ISBN, etc., follow the link to Simple Records Extract.
 
*Circulation:* Contains circulation records, including pre-catalogued item circulations. When an item is 
checked out, a circulation record is created. When an item is renewed, the existing circulation record is 
closed and another record is created. Below are some important timestamps in this table.
 
Checkout Date/Time: the time when an item is checked out
 
CheckIn Date/Time: the effective date when the item is treated as checked-in
 
CheckIn Scan Date/Time: the time when the check in action is taken

specific time with time zone information.
 
Fine Stops Date/Time: the date when the Maximum Fine limit has been reached, or the item is returned, marked 
lost or claimed returned. After this date, the fine generator will not create new overdue fines for this 
circulation.
 
Record Creation Date/Time: the date and time when the circulation record is created. For online checkout it 
is the same as Checkout Date/Time. For offline checkout, this date is the offline transaction processing date.
 
Transaction Finish Date/Time: the date when the bills linked to this checkout have been resolved. For a 
regular checkout without bills this field is filled with the checkin time when the item is returned.
 
*Non-catalogued Circulation:* When a non-catalogued checkout is recorded, a record is created in this table. 
Non-catalogued item category can be found in the linked Non-Cat Item Type table.
 
*In-house Use:*  Contains the catalogued item in-house use records.
 
*Non-catalogued In-house Use:*  Contains the non-catalogued item in-house use records. Follow the link to Item 
Type to find the non-catalogued item category.
 
*Copy Transit:*  When a copy is sent in transit, regardless of whether it is going back to its circulating 
library or going to fill a hold, a copy transit record is created in this table. Follow the link to Transit 
Copy to find the item information.
 
*Hold Transit:* When a copy is sent in transit to fill a hold, a hold transit record is created in this table 
and the Copy Transit table. So this table contains a subset of records of the Copy Transit table. You may find 
hold information following the link to Hold Requiring Transit. Follow the link to Transit Copy to find the 
item information.
 
*Hold Request:* When a hold is placed, a hold record is created in this table. You may find the hold receiver's 
information in Hold User. Requesting User is the person who takes the placing hold action. It can be the hold 
receiver or a staff member. Generally if the Hold User is different from the Requesting User, this is a 
staff-placed hold. Hold Copy Map equals Eligible Copies. Copies that can be used to fill the hold are in this 
table.
 
NOTE: Target Object ID is shown as a link. But there is no linked table in the Source pane. The value in this 
field could be a bibliographic record id, a volume record id or a copy record id depending on the hold type.
 
Timestamps in this table:
 
Capture Date/Time: The time when the hold achieves hold shelf or hold-in-transit status.
 
Fulfillment Date/Time: the time when the on-hold item is checked out.
 
Hold Cancel Date/Time: the time when the hold is cancelled.
 
Hold Expire Date/Time: This could be the date calculated based on your library's default Hold Expire Interval 
or a selected date when placing the hold.
 
Last Targeting Date/Time: The last time the hold targeting program checked for a target copy for the hold. 
It usually has the same time as the Hold Request Time. It is usually not useful for reporting, But it may 
serve as an indicator of whether the request time has been edited.
 
Notify Time: when the email notice is sent out.
 
Request Date/Time: Usually this is when the hold is placed. But it is editable on the staff client. So 
sometimes this may be the request time chosen by the staff.
 
Shelf Expire Time: the date is calculated based on the Shelf Time and your library's Default Hold Shelf 
Expire Interval.
 
Shelf Time: when the hold achieves On Hold Shelf status.
 
Thaw Date: the activation date for a suspended hold.
 
*Bills and Payments tables and views*

all the billing line items such as each day's overdue fines and the grocery bills created manually. The 
records in this table are viewable on the Full Details screen on Bills in the staff client.
 
Billable Transaction with Billing Location: this table contains the summary records of billings and payments. 
Most information in these records is displayed on Bills or Bills History screen. The records are updated when 
either the related billings or payments are updated. Transaction ID is the bill ID. It is also the circulation 
record ID for circulation bills. Transaction Start Time is the grocery bill creation time or circulation 
checkout time. Transaction Finish Time is when the bill is resolved.
 
Payments: ALL contains all payment records. When a lump sum of payment is made on the staff client, one 
or more payment records are created depending on the number of bills it resolved or partially resolved. 
One bill may be resolved by multiple payments.
 
Payments: Brick-and-mortar contains all payments made at the circulation desk.
 
Payments: Desk: Cash/Check/Credit Card payment.
 
Payments: Non-drawer Staff: Forgive/Work/Goods/Patron Credit payments.
 
[TIP] 
=====
* A view is a virtual table which contains records meeting defined requirements. The fields in a view can 
be from one or more tables. Before you use a view for your report, you need to make sure the view contains 
the type of records that you want to report on. For example, Overdue Circulation is a view which contains 
circulation records without checkin date and the due date past "today". It does not work for a report on 
last month's circulation statistics, but it makes an overdue report easier.
* anchor:nullability_commonly_used_tables[Nullability]By default, tables are often joined by inner join on the report interface, which means the result records should be in both linked tables. For example,an item may or may not be circulated, meaning having circulation records or not. An inner join between Circulation table and Item table will not contain those items that do not have circulation history, as there is no record in Circulation table for them. However, sometimes you may want to include all items. You may achieve it by using other join types, which can be defined by the Nullability checkbox beside the Source table list on Template Creation screen.  You may see Default, Child Nullable and Parent Nullable in a dropdown list in front of the table names. None means a inner join; Parent is right outer join, meaning all records in the Parent table (the linked from table) are included; Child is left outer join, meaning all records in the child table (the linked to table) are included.
