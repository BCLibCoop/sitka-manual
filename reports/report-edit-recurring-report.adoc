Viewing/Editing/Rescheduling Reports
------------------------------------

You may view or edit an existing report to change the values for filters, run-time, email reminder recipient, 
recurring interval, etc. For example, you may reschedule a recurring report to run on Mondays, 
instead of Thursdays. With this function, you may also generate a new report by editing and saving the report 
with a new name. 

You may edit a report from Reports or Output folder.
 
To view or edit a report in Reports folder, go to Reports folder to find the report that you wish to view/edit. 
Click View or Edit in the Edit column. We choose Edit in this example.

To edit a report in Output folder, go to Output to find the report. Click the report name. The details of the 
report show up in the line below. Click Edit.
 
 
The report is loaded on the report creation screen, where you make the required changes.
 
To create a new report, you need to enter a new report name. Click Save As New at the bottom after finishing 
the editing. You can choose to create a one time or a recurring report.
 
To modify an existing recurring report, click Save Report after finishing the editing. Note that Evergreen 
will update the pending output only. The existing output will remain as is.
 
It is not possible to modify a completed one-time report. You need to enter a new report name and save it 
as a new report.
 
When choosing View a report on the above two screens, the report will be displayed in non-editable mode.
