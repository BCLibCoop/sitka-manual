The folders pane is dived into two sections:

* _My Folders_ which contains the folders created with your Evergreen account.
* _Shared Folders_ which contains folders shared with you by other users.

There are three main components used by the reporter which each much be stored in a separate folder:

* _Templates_ which tell Evergreen what fields to offer as filters and what columns to display in the results file.
* _Reports_ which tell Evergreen what values to filter on, how often to run the report, and what file formats
to output the results in.
* _Output_ which is the final results file from Evergreen with the information from the database.

In order to work with templates, reports, and output in the reporter you must have at least one
folder created under each component.  See CREATING FOLDERS

Sharing Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Sharing Report Folders)))
(((Report Folders, Sharing)))

_Template_, _Report_, and _Output_ folders can be private (accessible to the user who created the folders) 
or shared with other staff at the library or other libraries in your federation or lending zone who have
reporter permissions. 

A folder must be shared with at least your library in order for Co-op Support to be able to view it
to assist with troubleshooting.


Sharing Your Folders
++++++++++++++++++++

Folders can be set as shared when they are created or updated afterwards.

. In the _My Folders_ pane click on the name of the folder that you wish to share.
. Click *Manage Folder*.
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-1.png[]
+
. From the drop down menu select *Share this folder* and click *Go*.
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-2.png[]
+
. Select the level at which you would like to share your folder.
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-3.png[]
+
. Click *Share this folder*.
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-4.png[]
+
. A pop-up will appear confirming the folder has been shared. Click *OK*.
. The folder will now show under _My Folders_ with the library code of the organizational unit it is 
shared with in parentheses. 
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-5.png[]

[CAUTION]
=========
A shared sub-folder must be created in a shared folder.  The shared sub-folder must have the same
share scope or a narrower share scope than the parent folder.

image::images/report/report-share-folders-6.png[]

Sub-folders created within unshared folders or folders that are shared with a wider scope than the 
parent folder will result in folders not displaying at all.  

Please be cautious when creating shared subfolders and contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] for assistance if you encounter this issue.

Viewing Shared Folders
++++++++++++++++++++++




The My Folders section contains folders created with your Evergreen
account. Folders that other users have shared with you appear in the Shared Folders section under the username
of the sharing account. You can only view the contents or clone the templates in the shared folders, but not make
any change in the shared folders. The cloned template can only be saved into your own folder.






////

There are three main components used by the Reports module: Templates, Reports, and Output. Each of these components
must be stored in a folder. Folders can be private (accessible to your login only) or shared with other staff at
your library or other libraries in your federation or lending zone. It is also possible to
selectively share only certain folders and/or subfolders.

CAUTION: A shared subfolder must be created in a shared folder. The sharing scope of the subfolder should be
within the sharing scope of the parent folder. For example, a subfolder shared with your federation should only be
in a parent folder shared with your federation. It should not be in a folder shared with your library only. Though creating
shared subfolders in unshared folders or a subfolder with the sharing scope exceeding its parent's is not blocked
by Evergreen, serious consequences will be caused by such folders. You must be cautious when creating shared
subfolders.

There are two parts in the folders pane. The My Folders section contains folders created with your Evergreen
account. Folders that other users have shared with you appear in the Shared Folders section under the username
of the sharing account. You can only view the contents or clone the templates in the shared folders, but not make
any change in the shared folders. The cloned template can only be saved into your own folder.

Creating Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether you are creating a report from scratch or working from a shared template you must first create at least one folder.

The steps for creating folders are similar for each reporting function. It is easier to create folders for templates, reports, and output all at once at the beginning, though it is possible to do it before each step. This example demonstrates creating a folder for a template.

. Click on *Templates* in the *My Folders* section.
+
image::images/report/folder-1.png[]
+
. Name the folder. Select *Share* or *Do not share* from the drop down menu.
. If you want to share your folder, select whom you want to share this folder with from the 
drop down menu.
+
image::images/report/folder-2.png[]
+
. Click *Create Sub Folder*, and then *OK* on the confirmation prompt.
. Next, create a folder for the report definition to be saved to. Click on *Reports*.
. Repeat steps 2-4 to create a Reports folder also called Circulation.
. Finally, you need to create a folder for the report's output to be saved in. Click on *Output*.
. Repeat steps 2-4 to create an Output folder named Circulation.

TIP: Using a parallel naming scheme for folders in Templates, Reports, and Output helps keep your reports organized and easier to find.

The folders you have just created, will now be visible by clicking the arrows in *My Folders*. Bracketed after the folder name, is the name of with whom the folder is shared. For example, Circulation (ZSP-B) is shared with the New Coopville Library. If it is not a shared folder, there will be nothing after the folder name. You may create as many folders and sub-folders as you like.

TIP: Clicking the blue text of a folder name displays the contents of the folder in the right pane. Clicking the arrow in front of a folder name displays its subfolders.

Managing Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a folder has been created, you can change the name, delete it, create a new subfolder, or change the sharing settings. This example demonstrates changing a folder name. The other choices follow similar steps.

. Click on the folder name that you wish to rename.
. Click *Manage Folder*.
+
image::images/report/folder-4.png[]
+
. Select *Change folder name* from the drop down menu and click *Go*.
+
image::images/report/folder-5.png[]
+
. Enter the new name and click *Submit*.
+
image::images/report/folder-6.png[]
+
. You will get a confirmation box that the Action Succeeded. Click *OK*.
