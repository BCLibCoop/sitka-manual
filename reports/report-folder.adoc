The folders pane in the reporter is divided into two sections:

* _My Folders_ which contains the folders created with your Evergreen account.
* _Shared Folders_ which contains folders shared with you by other users.

There are three main components used by the reporter which each much be stored in a separate folder:

* _Templates_ which tell Evergreen what fields to offer as filters and what columns to display in the results file.
* _Reports_ which tell Evergreen what values to filter on, how often to run the report, and what file formats
to output the results in.
* _Output_ which is the final results file from Evergreen with the information from the database.

In order to work with templates, reports, and output in the reporter you must have at least one
folder created under each component.  See xref:_creating_folders[].

[TIP] 
=====
Co-op Support recommends using a parallel naming scheme for folders in Templates, Reports, and Output 
to help keep your reports organized and easier to find.
=====

To create a folder within _Templates_, _Reports_, or _Output_:

. Go to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ section click on the folder you would like to create a sub-folder in. You may 
need to click on the caret(s) to expand the relevant folder tree.
+

Sharing Folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Share, Report Folders)))
(((Report Folders, Sharing)))

_Template_, _Report_, and _Output_ folders can be private (accessible only to the user who created 
the folder) or shared with other staff at the library or other libraries in your federation or 
lending zone who have reporter permissions. 

A folder must be shared with at least your library in order for Co-op Support to be able to view it
to assist with troubleshooting.

Folders can be shared at any time after they are created.

. Go to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ section click on the name of the folder that you wish to share.
. Select the *Share Folder* button.
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-1.png[]
+
. Select the level at which you would like to share your folder. Please choose your library, do not choose SITKA.
. Click *Save*.
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-2.png[]
+
. The folder will now show under _My Folders_ with the library code of the organizational unit it is 
shared with in parentheses. 
+
image::images/report/report-share-folders-3.png[]
+
. If you wish to change the share scope for the folder you must xref:_hiding_your_folders[hide the folder]
 and then re-share it with the new share scope.

[CAUTION]
=========
A shared sub-folder must be created in a shared folder.  The shared sub-folder must have the same
share scope or a narrower share scope than the parent folder.

image::images/report/report-share-folders-4.png[]

Sub-folders created within unshared folders or folders that are shared with a wider scope than the 
parent folder may result in folders not displaying at all.  

Please be cautious when creating shared subfolders and contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] for assistance if you encounter this issue.
=========


Hiding Your Folders
+++++++++++++++++++
(((Hide, Report Folders)))
(((Report Folders, Hide)))

Folders are hidden (unshared) by default.  Folders that have been shared can be hidden (unshared).

. Go to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _My Folders_ pane click on the name of the folder that you wish to hide.
. Select the *Unshare Folder* button.
+
image::images/report/report-hide-folders-1.png[]
+
. The folder will now show under _My Folders_ without a library code in parentheses.
+
image::images/report/report-hide-folders-2.png[]

[CAUTION]
=========
If the folder you wish to hide has shared sub-folders you need to hide the sub-folders first or
your folders may no longer display at all. 
=========
 
Viewing Shared Folders
++++++++++++++++++++++

(((View, Shared Report Folders)))
(((Report Folders, View Shared)))

Folders that are shared with your library, federation, or lending zone display in the _Shared Folders_
section.

image::images/report/report-view-shared-folders-1.png[]

The top level of shared folders displays the username of the account that has shared the folder.

While it is most common for users to share template folders, reports and output folders can be shared
as well.

You can only view the contents of the shared folders or clone the templates into your own folders.
