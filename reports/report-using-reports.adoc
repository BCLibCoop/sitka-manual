Using the Reporter
------------------

(((Reporter, Using)))

The basic steps to using Evergreen's reporter are:

. Find the template
.. Clone it into your folders if it was created by another user
. Run the report, also referred to as creating a report definition
. View your output either through the staff client or via your email


Cloning a Report Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Clone, Report Templates)))
(((Reporter, Cloning Templates)))

[CAUTION]
=========
Cloning templates created in previous verions of Evergreen may not work perfectly. You 
may need to remove, then put back some fields during cloning.
=========

https://youtu.be/QThSGXcaZP8[*Sitka Training Video - Cloning Shared Templates and Sitka Templates (3:32)*]

In Evergreen reports are run from templates that can be used multiple times.  Library staff can create their
own templates or clone templates from other users.

The steps below assume you have already created at least one folder in _Templates_.  If you have not 
done so, please see xref:_creating_folders[].

. Go to *Administration* -> *Reports*
. In the _Shared Folders_ section click on the caret beside the _Templates_ folder to see the shared
template folders. Use the carets to expand the folder tree until you find the folder containing
the template you would like to clone.
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-1.png[]
+
. Select the folder name to display the contents.
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-2.png[]
+
[TIP]
=====
By default, Evergreen only displays the first 10 items in any folder. To view all content, change the Rows grid setting from 10 to a higher number. Be aware that using 100 may cause performance issues.
=====
+
. Check the box beside the template you wish to clone.
. Right click or use the *Actions* menu to choose *Clone Template*. 
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-3.png[]
+
. The template editor will open.  For information on modifying templates see 
xref:_modifying_report_templates[].
. Update the template name and/or template description if desired.
. Select the name of your folder where you'd like to save the cloned template. 
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-4.png[]
+
. Select *Save*.
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-5.png[]
+
. A pop-up will appear confirming that the _Template Saved Successfully_.
. The template can now be found in the folder you saved it in.
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-6.png[]

Searching for Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Search, Report Templates)))
(((Reporter, Searching for Templates)))

If you do not know the home folder for a template you desire, or if you want to explore templates shared by other accounts, you can use the reporter search function.

. Go to *Administration* -> *Reports*
. Select the *Search& tab located above _My Folders_.
+
image::images/report/search-report-template-1.png[]
+
. Enter a search term in the field *Search Templates for String*.
. Scope your search to _Name_, _Description_, or _All Fields_.
. Limit your search to a particular folder using the carets beside the folder tree to locate your targeted folder, or leave the search at the _All Folders_ level.
+
image::images/report/search-report-template-2.png[]
+
. Select your desired template and right click or use the *Actions* menu to select *Clone Template*.
. The template editor will open. For information on modifying templates, see the section on Modifying Templates.
. Update the template name and/or template description if desired.
. Select the name of your folder where you'd like to save the cloned template. 
. Select *Save*. Once a template is saved it is not possible to edit the template. To make changes, clone a template and change the clone.
. The template can now be found in the folder you saved it in.

Running a Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Run, Reports)))
(((Reporter, Run Reports)))

https://youtu.be/QUaSHyI2CWw[*Sitka Training Video - Running a Report (5:07)*]

You can run one off reports on demand or schedule recurring reports to run automatically.  To run the 
report you fill out the reports form which creates a report definition, which tells Evergreen how to run 
the report, what information to include, and what type of output to provide you with.

[TIP]
=====
Examples of how to fill in the report definition for commonly used report templates can be
found in xref:_report_definition_examples[].
===== 

. Go to *Administration* -> *Reports*
. In the _My Folders_ section select the caret beside the _Templates_ folder to see your 
template folders. Use the carets to expand the folder tree until you find the folder containing
the template you would like to use for your report.
. Select a folder name to display the contents.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-1.png[]
+
. Double click on the desired template name or check the box beside the template you wish to use and then right click or use the *Actions* menu to select _New Report_.
. Enter a name for your report. Report names must be unique, or the report cannot be saved.
+
[TIP]
=====
A best practice for naming reports is to use the same name as the template you used. This makes it easy to track outputs and reports back to the template used. If multiple reports are made from the same template, the format of 'template name' - 'report characteristic' can make those reports easy to track.
=====
. Optionally, enter a description for your report.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-2.png[]
+
. The display columns selected in the template are listed on the Columns tab. You can navigate between tabs by clicking on the tabs or by using the Previous and Next buttons at the bottom of the screen.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-3.png[]
+
. On the Filters tab, enter values for any filters. For more information on filter values see xref:_report_filters[].
+
image::images/report/reports-run-4.png[]
+
[NOTE]
=====
Instead of scrolling through the options in the filter lists, you can place your cursor in the filter value box and then on your keyboard start typing the first few letters that the option you want starts with. This will limit your list to just those options that match what you have typed.
=====
+
. On the Layout and Scheduling tab you can make a number of choices about the final output.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-5.png[]
+
.. *Pivot Label Column* and *Pivot Data Column* are optional. Pivot tables are a different way to view data. If you currently use pivot tables to manipulate report data in Microsoft Excel, it is better to select an Excel output and continue using pivot tables in Excel. Note that pivot tables are only suitable for some types of result data.
.. Select the checkboxes to _Choose your output format(s)_. Multiple options may be selected.
... Select the _Calculate grouping subtotals_ checkbox to add an unlabeled row or column with the subtotals for each grouping and an unlabeled grand total row or column. Note, group subtotals and grand totals will only be useful with some reports.
... _Excel output_ will create a file to export the data to Excel.
... _CSV Output_ will create a data file in comma-separated values format. This is the file format required to do a batch load on the Item Status screen.
... _HTML Output_ creates a simple table view of the data that is viewable in your browser environment. HTML Output is sometimes referred to as tabular output.
... _Bar Chart_ will create a very simple bar chart of your data. Note, bar charts will only be useful with some reports.
... _Line Chart_ will create a very simple line chart of your data. Note, line charts will only be useful with some reports.
. Leave the recurring and run time options as is unless you are running a recurring report.  See
xref:_recurring_reports[].
. Optionally, enter an email address to send the report completion notification to.  By default this 
field will contain the email address saved in your staff account. Additional addresses can be added 
separated by a comma.
+
[NOTE]
======
Any report output you wish to share with other staff must be stored in a shared output folder.  This is the case even if staff have the “View Output” permission and get the email link sent to them. The email will contain a link to the password-protected report output.  
Only staff members with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter will be able to 
open the report output and only if the output folder is shared. Staff who only need to view report
output must first to fill out the

. On the right side of the screen, Choose the _Report Folder_ and _Output Folder_ you would like to save the report and output in.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-6.png[]
+
. Select *Save and schedule report*.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-7.png[]
+
. A confirmation will appear in the lower right of the screen indicating that the report has successfully saved.
. Unless you have set a specific run time the report will run right away.  If your report has not 
completed after 15 minutes please contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].
. Once the report is complete you can view your output.  See xref:_viewing_report_output[]. 

Report Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Filter, Reports)))
(((Report Filters)))
(((Reporter, Report Filters)))

The filters in a report template allow library staff to set the parameters on which the report runs. The
ability to select values for certain filters when running a report means a single report template can 
be used multiple times to generate reports on slightly different data.  For example, the same report 
template can be used to generate separate lists of items using particular circulation modifiers.

Hardcoded Filters
+++++++++++++++++

(((Report Filters, Hardcoded)))

Hardcoded filters are set when the report template is created.  These filters cannot be changed when 
running a report. Common hardcoded filters include:


[options="header"]
|===
|Column |Transform |Action |User Params |Description 
|Bibliographic Record -> Record ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | Exclude all records where
the bibliographic record ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Call Number/Volume -> Call Number/Volume ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | Exclude all records where
the call number ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Circulation -> Check In Date/Time |Date |Is NULL| |Include only items that have not been checked in.
|Circulation -> Circulating Item -> Item Status -> Name |Raw Data |Equals | name of an item status | Include
only items that are in the specified item status.
|Circulation -> Fine Stop Reason |Raw Data |Not in list |LOST | Exclude items that have stopped generating
fines because they have been set to lost.
|Item -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only un-deleted items.
|ILS User -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only un-deleted patrons.
|===

[[_report_date_filters]]
Date Filters
++++++++++++

(((Report Filters, Date)))

Date filters are generally set up to be a specific date, a specific month, or a date range. Date filters
will often include tips about how the dates should be entered. For instance, in a date range the earlier
date should always be entered in the first date box.

image::images/report/reports-filters-1.png[]

If you'd like to include all possible data for your library in a report that specifies a time range, 
enter between "1900-01-01" and "today's date".

When running recurring reports it's very important to use _Relative Dates_ in your filters.  This will
allow Evergreen to calculate the time period to report on each time it runs the report. A relative date of
1 month ago will generate a new report each month on the previous month's data; a real date of November
2024 will generate the same report each month with the data from November 2024.  

[TIP]
=====
You can set up recurring monthly reports to show comparative data from one year ago. To do this 
select relative dates of 1 month ago and 13 months ago.
=====

Use the _Relative time value_ checkbox under _Filter value_ to switch from a specific real date to a relative date. For a report filtering on month, you will be able to indicate how many months ago the report should look at.  

image::images/report/reports-filters-2.png[]

Library Filters
+++++++++++++++

(((Report Filters, Library)))

All report templates used by libraries will include a library filter.  This filter can look at the 
library specified in a variety of fields in the data including the checkout library, circulation library,
owning library, patron's home library, and organizational unit. 

image::images/report/reports-filters-3.png[]

This filter is important as it allows 
staff to comply with Sitka's data use requirements as per https://librariescoop.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/Board/EbkI4ll_0ydEifawYC3l9ScBVAh3SqcfkrMUbBHWzzm-Bg?e=5wD8Q5[Appendix J of the Service Management Agreement] and restrict the data in the report output to only data relevant 
to their library.

Multi-branch libraries can add specific branches or all of their branches to the list to get a report 
including data from the select branches.

Other Filters
+++++++++++++

While many filters will require staff to select values from a given list, some filters will require staff to 
type a value into the _Filter value_ field. In those cases the report will generally indicate
how the text should be entered so that Evergreen can use the value and generate usable report output.

image::images/report/reports-filters-4.png[]

Some report templates will have just hardcoded filters and a single library filter that requires 
staff to enter a value while other reports will have multiple filters where staff need to enter values
for the library, dates, and patron or item data.


Recurring Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Recurring Reports)))
(((Reporter, Recurring Reports)))

https://youtu.be/9A_IUX6bg9o[*Sitka Training Video - Recurring Reports (3:47)*]

Save time by scheduling recurring reports to run your regular reports automatically. Monthly circulation 
and patron registration statistics are good candidates for recurring reports.

Staff with access to the reporter can set up recurring reports to email a link to the password-protected 
report output to another staff member. If you have recurring reports set up to be sent to other staff at your library, please make sure the output folder is shared with your library. (Multibranch libraries should share at the System level.)Staff who only need to view report
output must first to fill out the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/all-staff-reporter-privacy-waiver/[All
Staff Reporter Privacy Waiver]. 


To set up a recurring report, follow the procedure in xref:_running_a_report[] until you reach
the _Recurrence_ and _Scheduling_ sections and then follow the steps below.
 
. Select the box for *Recurring Report*.
. Select your desired _Recurrence Interval_. Reports can run on a daily, weekly, or monthly interval.
+
[TIP] 
=====
The recurrence interval should correspond to the date filter. For example, if the template filters 
on a date instead of month, a recurring report running with a monthly interval may miss a day or capture 
an extra day's data. See xref:_report_date_filters[] for more information on working with date filters on
a recurring report.
=====
+
. Select _Schedule Report for Later_ and set the date and time of the first run of the report.
+
image::images/report/reports-recurring-1.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
Best practice is to always set recurring reports to run in the early hours
of the morning (1:00am PT to 4:00am PT).

Monthly recurring reports MUST be set to run on the 1st of the next month in order to capture all monthly
data.
======
+
. Enter an email address to send the report completion notification to.  By default this 
field will contain the email address saved in your staff account. Additional addresses can be added 
separated by a comma. If you have recurring reports set up to be sent to other staff at your library, please make sure the output folder is shared with your library. (Multibranch libraries should share at the System level.) 
+

Once a report is finished, the output is stored in the specified _Output_ folder and will remain there until deleted. Co-op Support automatically deletes report output after one year. If an email address was included in the report definition Evergreen will send an
email containing a link to the password-protected report output.
 
Only staff members with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter will be able to 
open the report output in either the staff client or via the email link. Shared output must be stored in a shared output folder. Staff who only need to view report

Maintaining Reporter Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Reporter, Maintaining Data)))

Saved report templates will stay in the Sitka database forever unless deleted by the template owner.  
Report definitions and output more than 3 years old are deleted annually by Co-op Support.
  When a template or report definition is deleted all the linked definitions and output
files are also deleted.

Co-op Support recommends downloading output you need to keep as CSV or Excel output and saving it 
locally on your computer harddrive or a shared drive.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdwlgwBNnH4qhcFztHmgdU4p9nBxCK0tL[*Playlist - Maintaining Reporter Data*]

Maintaining Your Report Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Report Template, Maintain)))
(((Reporter, Maintaining Report Templates)))

As Evergreen evolves from version to version the database tables sometimes change prompting Co-op Staff 
to update the relevant templates in Sitka_templates.  To ensure Evergreen is gathering the 
correct data it is important to review the templates you use on a yearly basis and clone new templates 
from Sitka_templates when older versions of a template are retired.

The _create_time_ field can be used to determine if your version of a template was created before or after
the current version of the template in Sitka_templates.

image::images/report/report-maintain-templates-1.png[]

If you are modifying existing templates or creating your own templates Co-op Support recommends ensuring
you delete interim versions of the template created while working on the template.  This makes it easier
to be sure you are using the correct version of the template.

[TIP]
=====
Library staff should periodically run a report using the template _Reports Run In Specified Time Period By Specified Library_ to see what reports are being run at their library. 
This template can be found under Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Local Administration.
 
Recurring reports running directly off of Sitka templates or using accounts of former staff members should be stopped and new recurring reports set up properly.
