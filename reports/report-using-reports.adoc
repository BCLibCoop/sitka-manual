Using the Reporter
------------------

(((Reporter, Using)))

The basic steps to using Evergreen's reporter are:

. Find the template
.. Clone it into your folders if it was created by another user
. Run the report, also referred to as creating a report definition
. View your output either through the staff client or via your email


Cloning a Report Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Clone, Report Templates)))
(((Reporter, Cloning Templates)))

////
[CAUTION]
=========
Cloning templates created on the old staff client (XUL in ui column) may not work perfectly. You 
may need to remove, then put back some fields during cloning.

IS THIS STILL TRUE?
=========
////


link:https://youtu.be/0F0dulXsUKw[*Cloning Reports and Sitka Templates (2:35)*]

In Evergreen reports are run from templates that can be used multiple times.  Library staff can create their
own templates or clone templates from other users.

The steps below assume you have already created at least one folder in _Templates_.  If you have not 
done so, please see xref:_creating_folders[].

. Go to *Administration* -> *Reports*
. In the _Shared Folders_ section click on the arrow beside the _Templates_ folder to see the shared
template folders. Use the arrows to expand the folder tree until you find the folder containing
the template you would like to clone.
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-1.png[]
+
. Click on the folder name to display the contents.
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-2.png[]
+
. Check the box beside the template you wish to clone.
. From the drop down menu choose *Clone selected template*.  Click *Submit*. 
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-3.png[]
+
[TIP]
=====
By default Evergreen only displays the first 10 items in any folder. To view all content,
change the _Limit output to_ setting from _10_ to _All_.
=====
+
. Click on the name of your folder where you'd like to save the cloned template and then 
click *Select Folder*. 
+
image::images/report/clone-report-template-4.png[]

Report Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Filter, Reports)))
(((Report Filters)))
(((Reporter, Report Filters)))

The filters in a report template allow library staff to set the parameters on which the report runs. The
ability to select values for certain filters when running a report means a single report template can 
be used multiple times to generate reports on slightly different data.  For example, the same report 
template can be used to generate separate lists of items using particular circulation modifiers.

Hardcoded Filters
+++++++++++++++++

(((Report Filters, Hardcoded)))

Hardcoded filters are set when the report template is created.  These filters cannot be changed when 
running a report. Common hardcoded filters include:


[options="header"]
|===
|Column |Transform |Action |User Params |Description 
|Bibliographic Record -> Record ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | Exclude all records where
the bibliographic record ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Call Number/Volume -> Call Number/Volume ID |Raw Data |Not in list |-1 | Exclude all records where
the call number ID is -1 which is all pre-cat records.
|Circulation -> Check In Date/Time |Date |Is NULL| |Include only items that have not been checked in.
|Circulation -> Circulating Item -> Copy Status -> Name |Raw Data |Equals | name of an item status | Include
only items that are in the specified item status.
|Circulation -> Fine Stop Reason |Raw Data |Not in list |LOST | Exclude items that have stopped generating
fines because they have been set to lost.
|Item -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only un-deleted items.
|ILS User -> Is Deleted |Raw Data |Equals |f | Include only un-deleted patrons.
|===

[[_report_date_filters]]
Date Filters
++++++++++++

(((Report Filters, Date)))

Date filters are generally set up to be a specific date, a specific month, or a date range. Date filters
will often include tips about how the dates should be entered. For instance, in a date range the earlier
date should always be entered in the first date box.

image::images/report/reports-filters-1.png[]

If you'd like to include all possible data for your library in a report that specifies a time range, 
enter between "1900-01-01" and "today's date".

When running recurring reports it's very important to use _Relative Dates_ in your filters.  This will
allow Evergreen to calculate the time period to report on each time it runs the report. A relative date of
1 month ago will generate a new report each month on the previous month's data; a real date of November
2022 will generate the same report each month with the data from November 2022.  

[TIP]
=====
You can set up recurring monthly reports to show comparative data from one year ago. To do this 
select relative dates of 1 month ago and 13 months ago.
=====

Use the drop down menu to switch from _Real Date_ to _Relative Date_.  For a report filtering on month, you 
will be able to indicate how many months ago the report should look at.  

image::images/report/reports-filters-2.png[]

Library Filters
+++++++++++++++

(((Report Filters, Library)))

All report templates used by libraries will include a library filter.  This filter can look at the 
library specified in a variety of fields in the data including the checkout library, circulation library,
owning library, patron's home library, and organizational unit. 

image::images/report/reports-filters-3.png[]

This filter is important as it allows 
staff to comply with Sitka's data use requirements as per 
https://ln.sync.com/dl/ca731e4e0/view/doc/7839812630003#bw5v92du-w6q5j6uj-szy6shez-smwueqdv[Appendix J 
of the Service Management Agreement] and restrict the data in the report output to only data relevant 
to their library.

Multi-branch libraries can add specific branches or all of their branches to the list to get a report 
including data from the select branches.

Other Filters
+++++++++++++

While many filters will require staff to select values from a given list, some filters will require staff to 
type a value into the filter _User Params_ field. In those cases the report will generally indicate
how the text should be entered so that Evergreen can use the value and generate usable report output.

image::images/report/reports-filters-4.png[]

Some report templates will have just hardcoded filters and a single library filter that requires 
staff to enter a value while other reports will have multiple filters where staff need to enter values
for the library, dates, and patron or item data.

image::images/report/reports-filters-5.png[]

Recurring Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Recurring Reports)))
(((Reporter, Recurring Reports)))

link:https://youtu.be/WS6vRrpqIZY[*Recurring Reports (3:02)*]

Save time by scheduling recurring reports to run your regular reports automatically. Monthly circulation 
and patron registration statistics are good candidates for recurring reports.

Staff with access to the reporter can set up recurring reports to email a link to the password-protected 
report output to another staff member. Staff who only need to view report
output must first to fill out the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/all-staff-reporter-privacy-waiver/[All
Staff Reporter Privacy Waiver].


To set up a recurring report, follow the procedure in xref:_running_a_report[] until you reach
step 11 and then follow the steps below.
 
. Check the box for *Recurring Report*.
. Select your desired _Recurrence Interval_. Reports can run on a daily, weekly, or monthly interval.
+
[TIP] 
=====
The recurrence interval should correspond to the date filter. For example, if the template filters 
on a date instead of month, a recurring report running with a monthly interval may miss a day or capture 
an extra day's data. See xref:_report_date_filters[] for more information on working with date filters on
a recurring report.
=====
+
. Check the box beside the date and set the date of the first run of the report.
+
image::images/report/reports-recurring-1.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
Best practice is to always set recurring reports to run in the early hours
of the morning (1:00am PT to 4:00am PT).

Monthly recurring reports MUST be set to run on the 1st of the next month in order to capture all monthly
data.
======
+
. Enter an email address to send the report completion notification to.  By default this 
field will contain the email address saved in your staff account. Additional addresses can be added 
separated by a comma.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-10.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
The email will contain a link to the password-protected report output. 
Only staff members with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter will be able to 
open the report output. Staff who only need to view report
output must first to fill out the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/all-staff-reporter-privacy-waiver/[All
Staff Reporter Privacy Waiver].
======
+
. Choose the Ouput folder you would like to save the report output in and then click *Save Report*.
+
image::images/report/reports-run-11.png[]
+
. A pop-up appears confirming the report has been saved. Click *OK*.
. Unless you have set a specific run time the report will run right away.  If your report has not 
completed after 15 minutes please contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].
. Once the report is complete you can view your output.  See xref:_viewing_report_output[]. 
 
Viewing Report Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((View, Report Output)))
(((Reporter, View Report Output)))

link:https://youtu.be/SeAiy3jBVGg[*Viewing Report Output (2:08)*]

Once a report is finished, the output is stored in the specified _Output_ folder and will remain there until
manually deleted. If an email address was included in the report definition Evergreen will send an
email containing a link to the password-protected report output.
 
Only staff members with permissions to view reports or full access to the reporter will be able to 
open the report output in either the staff client or via the email link. Staff who only need to view report
output must first to fill out the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/all-staff-reporter-privacy-waiver/[All

Unless you have set a specific run time reports generally take about 5 minutes to complete.  If your 
report still shows as pending in the your output folder after 15 minutes please 
contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].

Maintaining Reporter Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Reporter, Maintaining Data)))

Saved report templates will stay in the Sitka database forever unless deleted by the template owner.  Report definitions and output are deleted on a yearly basis by Co-op Support.
  When a template or report definition is deleted all the linked definitions and output
files are also deleted.

Co-op Support recommends downloading output you need to keep as CSV or Excel output and saving it 
locally on your computer harddrive or a shared drive.

link:https://youtu.be/1CGqlSApwBs[*Managing Reports (3:02)*]

Maintaining Your Report Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Report Template, Maintain)))
(((Reporter, Maintaining Report Templates)))

As Evergreen evolves from version to version the database tables sometimes change prompting Co-op Staff 
to update the relevant templates in Sitka_templates.  To ensure Evergreen is gathering the 
correct data it is important to review the templates you use on a yearly basis and clone new templates 
from Sitka_templates when older versions of a template are retired.

The _create_time_ field can be used to determine if your version of a template was created before or after
the current version of the template in Sitka_templates.

image::images/report/report-maintain-templates-1.png[]

If you are modifying existing templates or creating your own templates Co-op Support recommends ensuring
you delete interim versions of the template created while working on the template.  This makes it easier
to be sure you are using the correct version of the template.

[TIP]
=====
Library staff should periodically run a report using the template _Reports Run In Specified Time Period By Specified Library_ to see what reports are being run at their library. 
This template can be found under Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Local Administration.
 
Recurring reports running directly off of Sitka templates or using accounts of former staff members should be stopped and new recurring reports set up properly.  
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Submit a ticket] to request assistance with stopping recurring reports for former staff members.
