Shared Sitka Templates
----------------------

CAUTION: Cloning templates created on the old staff client (XUL in ui column) may not work perfectly. You may need to remove, then put back some fields during cloning.

Co-op support has created generic templates for commonly requested reports and shared them under
the Sitka_templates folder. This chapter describes how to make local copies of these templates for
routine reports or as a starting point for customization. When creating a new template it is a good idea
to review the shared templates first: even if the exact template you need does not exist, it is often faster
to modify an existing template than to build a brand new one. Reporter permissions are required to clone
templates from the Shared Folders section and save them to My Folders.

What's in Sitka_templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Co-op support uses a dedicated staff account, Sitka_templates, to share ready-to-use templates.
Below is what a user with reporter permissions can see after going to the Reports module, then follow the
path to Shared Folders, click the arrow (or + sign) in front of Templates, and then Sitka_templates.

From Acquisitions to Serials are the subfolders containing various templates. Templates using
the same source table are usually grouped together under one subfolder. These templates are created based
on the anticipation that most libraries may need such reports. Co-op support tends to make these templates
generic, which means they contain more information. Individual libraries may have slightly different
requirements. You can remove the unwanted information when cloning the templates or choose appropriate
values for some filters to disable them. These templates are usually referred to as Sitka standard templates.

The following is a guideline of the templates for various kinds of reports. Please note that Co-op support regularly maintains the templates. The list below may not be the latest.

*Overdue reports*. Find overdue reports in Circulation > Overdue and Others folder. There are templates capturing checkouts
with due date within a selected time frame for all patrons or those without email address (phone list)
or the due date is before a selected date. You may use these templates to set up your overdue reports
capturing items which are at a certain number of days overdue.

*Circulation statistics reports*. These templates are in Circulation > Monthly Circulation Stats and Circulation > Circulation within Time Frame folders. Templates in the former folder are designed for monthly recurring reports. The regular circulation
statistics can be grouped by various criteria: patron's home library, profile and/or stat cat; items'
owning library and/or shelving location.

Other circulation statistics related templates are:

* non-catalogued circulation count
* pre-catalogued circulation count
* pre-catalogued circulation count for items with dummy title prefix of "ILL:" (ILL statistics via pre-catalogued circulation)
* checkin count
* in-house use count for non-catalogued items
* in-house use count for catalogued items
* in-house use count per title

Other circulation related templates are:

* lost and paid item list
* lost with outstanding bills item list
* claimed returned item list

*Reports on collection*. These templates are in Collection folder. You will find templates counting items
or titles of your whole collection or catalogued within the selected time period (new title/items statistics).
The numbers are grouped by shelving location and/or circulation modifier. The templates are in Copy and Title Count subfolder.

Another group of templates in Collection folder are item/title lists for items meeting various criteria:
having selected shelving location(s) and/or circulation modifier(s), copy stat cat, barcode prefix, call
number prefix or within a call number range; or being catalogued (new title/item list), marked missing,
lost or deleted within selected time period. These templates are in Copy List by Item Attributes and Title List subfolders.

In this folder, you will also find templates listing pre-catalogued items and items with certain circulation
history (items with fewer circulation count for weeding report or more circulation count for popular
title/item report). They are in Others folder.

*Patron reports*. All patron reports are in Patrons folder. You may find templates counting patrons by
profile group and/or patron stat cat, registered or expired/expiring within a selected time period, or
with circulation history within a selected time period.

Another group of templates list selected information for patrons meeting some conditions such as: email list
for all or those patrons having certain stat cat; names and barcode for patrons without circulation history
within selected time frame; patrons born before a selected date (seniors list); patrons exceeding maximum
fine limit.

Besides, there is a template that counts patron's OPAC logins and another that summarizes the answers to
patron survey question(s).

*Reports on bibliographic information*. It is not easy to generate reports based on bibliographic
information due to the bibliographic record structure. But a simple report that lists the values in a
selected MARC tag and subfield for the whole collection is possible. And the bibliographic records can be
limited by a selected value of a MARC tag and subfield. These templates are in Bibliographic Records folder.

*Bills and payments*. You can find the templates listing the details of various kinds of payments made
in a selected time period, and a template listing bills with negative balance.

*Hold reports*. Holds related reports are in this folder, including reports for holds that have been long
time outstanding (requested some time ago but not filled yet), cancelled, or have no eligible copies to be
filled. There are other templates that count the total number of holds placed or fulfilled within a time
span, and the hold count per title for popular titles.

*Inventory*. The two templates in Inventory folder list items based on whether the item showed up
(being scanned on shelves or returned) in the library while the inventory was taken. The result of
the Inventory - un-scanned items are the potential missing items.

*Library setting and policy related reports*. Find them in Library Configuration folder.

*Other folders*. If your library uses the Acquisitions Module, Serials or the Booking Module, you may find related
templates in the relevant folders.

*Custom Templates folder*. If you open this folder, you will see a subfolder for your library federation
with sub-subfolders for your library and other libraries within your library federation.

These folders are created when Co-op support creates or customizes templates for individual
libraries. The templates go to these folders when there are similar templates in the standard folders
already, or Co-op support does not anticipate wide use of the templates. Co-op support tries to
limit the number of templates in each standard folder so that staff may find the target template easily.

Clone a template from Sitka_templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps below assume you have already created at least one Templates folder.  If you have not done so,
please see xref:_folders[].

. Access the Reports interface from *Administration* -> *Reports*
. Under Shared Folders expand the Templates folder and the Sitka_templates subfolder.  To expand the
folders click on the grey arrow or folder icon.  Do not click on the blue underlined hyperlink.
. Expand the Circulation (SITKA) folder, then click on Monthly Circulation Stats (the blue text) to list templates in it.
+
image::images/report/clone-template-1.png[]
+
. Select the template you wish to clone. In this example, we are cloning the Monthly Circulation
by Shelving Location template.  From the drop down menu choose *Clone selected template*, then click *Submit*. 
+
image::images/report/clone-template-2.png[]
+
TIP: By default Evergreen only displays the first 10 items in any folder. To view all content,
change the Limit output setting from 10 to All.
+
. Choose the folder where you want to save the cloned template, then click *Select Folder*. Only template
folders created with your account will be visible.
+
image::images/report/clone-template-3.png[]
+
. The cloned template opens in the template editor. From here you may modify the template by adding,
removing, or editing fields and filters as described in xref:_creating_templates[]. Template Name
and Description can also be edited. When satisfied with your changes, click *Save Template*.
. Click *OK/Continue* in the resulting confirmation window.

Modify a template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once saved, it is not possible to edit a template. To make changes, clone the template and change the clone.

To modify a template, repeat the steps 1-6 in cloning a template. You will see the template open on Template Creating screen. Here you can add/remove/edit fields as when you create a new template.

To operate on Displayed fields, click Displayed Fields. You will see all the displayed fields. To remove one, highlight it and click *Actions* >
*Remove Selected Field*. You may move a field up or down the list, which will affect the sorting of the
result records. You may also change the column label or the transform of the field by using respective
functions on the Actions list.

[TIP]
=====
* Removing displayed fields usually does not affect the result set. But sometimes it does, esp. when the
report displays the count of records by each group. Sometimes some fields may contain important information.
Removing them may cause misunderstanding the results. Usually such fields are explained in the template
Description. Be cautious when you delete such fields.
* Be careful with editing filter fields, as usually changing a filter makes a difference in the result set.
=====

You may add fields. See xref:_creating_templates[] for details on operating on fields.


CAUTION: You can not change the starting source table, but have to follow the links to tables in the Sources
pane. Changing the starting table will remove all existing fields, meaning building a new template from scratch.


Examples of using Sitka's templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CAUTION: Please clone templates in Sitka_templates and set up your reports from your own copy. This is to avoid any
potential impact that may be resulted from changing the orignal templates. Co-op support regularly
maintains these templates. Deletion may happen. Deleting a template will delete all linked reports and
output files.

Below are a few screenshots showing you how to set up the reports based on some templates in Sitka_templates.
Some explanation is added in the orange boxes and text.

. Setting up a monthly recurring report by using template: Monthly Circulation by Shelving Location in Circulation > Monthly circulation stats folder:
+
image::images/report/sitka-example-1.png[]
+
. Setting up a weekly recurring report by using template: Overdues Within Time Span - for Patrons without
Email in Circulation > Overdue and others folder:
+
image::images/report/sitka-example-2.png[]

. Setting up a one-time report by using template: By Patron Stat Cat : Circ Stat within Time Span in Circulation > Circulation within time frame folder:
+
image::images/report/sitka-example-3.png[]
+
. Setting up a one-time report by using template: Shelving Location : Copies with Selected Shelving Location in Collection > Copy List by Item Attributes folder:
+
