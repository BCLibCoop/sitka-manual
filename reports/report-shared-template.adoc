Co-op Support has created ready-to-use report templates for commonly needed reports.  These templates are 
shared with all of Sitka and can be found in the _Templates_ folder in the _Shared Folders_ section in Evergreen's 
reporter. The username of the account is Sitka_templates.

Sitka templates are designed to be used by any Sitka library and so will often include more filter options or
display columns than a particular library may need.  Library staff can modify the templates to customize 
them for their library's needs.

We recommend reviewing the shared Sitka templates before contacting Co-op Support for reports assistance or 
creating your own templates.  Even if the exact template you need doesn't exist, you can 
usually find an existing one that is close to what you need which can be then be modified.

Library staff can also access xref:_custom_templates[custom templates] created for their library by 
Co-op Staff through the Sitka_templates folder.

[NOTE]
======
When using Sitka templates it is critical that you first xref:_cloning_a_report_template[clone the template]
 into your own folders.  

Reports run directly from Sitka templates cause problems for Co-op Staff when templates need to be updated
or retired.

If you encounter issues running a report cloned from Sitka templates please contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] with the name of the template and the folder you 
cloned it from.

What's in Sitka_templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
