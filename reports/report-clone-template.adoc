Cloning Report Templates
------------------------

CAUTION: Cloning templates created on the old staff client (XUL in ui column) may not work perfectly. You may need to remove, then put back some fields during cloning.

The steps below assume you have already created at least one Templates folder.  If you have not done so,
please see xref:_folders[].

. Access the Reports interface from *Administration* -> *Reports*
. Under Shared Folders expand the Templates folder and the Sitka_templates subfolder.  To expand the
folders click on the grey arrow or folder icon.  Do not click on the blue underlined hyperlink.
. Expand the Circulation (SITKA) folder, then click on Monthly Circulation Stats (the blue text) to list templates in it.

by Shelving Location template.  From the drop down menu choose *Clone selected template*, then click *Submit*.

TIP: By default Evergreen only displays the first 10 items in any folder. To view all content,
change the Limit output setting from 10 to All.
+
. Choose the folder where you want to save the cloned template, then click *Select Folder*. Only template
folders created with your account will be visible.

. The cloned template opens in the template editor. From here you may modify the template by adding,
removing, or editing fields and filters as described in xref:_creating_templates[]. Template Name
and Description can also be edited. When satisfied with your changes, click *Save Template*.
. Click *OK/Continue* in the resulting confirmation window.
