Accessing the Reporter
----------------------

The Reports interface is accessed in Evergreen by going to *Administration* -> *Reports*.

Users without reporter permissions granted to their staff account will see the message _You do 
not have sufficient permissions to run reports_.

Any staff needing access to the reporter must sign and submit the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/full-reporter-privacy-waiver/[Full 
Reporter Privacy Waiver].  Once the waiver is completed, if the staff account meets the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[required criteria],
Co-op Support will grant reporter permissions to the account. 

Staff with reporter permissions can use the Sitka report templates _Staff Assigned to Selected Permissions
Group(s)_ and _Staff Assigned to Supplementary Permission Group(s)_ to check who at their library
has reporter permissions.  Both report templates are found under _Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates
 -> Patrons -> Other_.
