(((Permissions, Reporter)))

As it is possible to report on almost every field in every table in the Evergreen database
a number of xref:_reporter_security[security measures] are in place to help libraries protect 
their patron data. 

In accordance with https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/sitka-shared-library-database-detailed-privacy-policy/[Sitka’s 
privacy policy] and owing to the nature of Sitka’s shared 
Evergreen database any staff needing access to the reporter must sign and submit the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/full-reporter-privacy-waiver/[Full 
Reporter Privacy Waiver].  Once the waiver is completed, if the staff account meets the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[required criteria],
Co-op Support will grant reporter permissions to the account. 

There are three main components used by the reporter:

* report template
* report definition
* report output

These components are saved in xref:_folders[folders] specific to the library account. Users can 
xref:_sharing_folders[share their folders] to allow others to clone templates and view report definitions 
and output but only the owning staff account can manage the contents of their folders.

[NOTE]

The following videos demonstrate running reports in Evergreen.

[TIP]
=====
Know which library staff at your library have recurring reports set up and make sure to stop those reports
when the staff member leaves your library.  

Once a xref:_closing_library_staff_accounts[library staff account is closed] it is no longer possible to 
access the reporter via the staff client and you will require assistance from Co-op Support to stop any 
recurring reports run by the library staff account.
=====

Report templates tell Evergreen what fields are to be displayed in the report output and
what conditions to filter on in the database. These templates 
allow you to run a report more than once, without building it anew every time.  Co-op Support has
created xref:_shared_sitka_templates[shared Sitka templates] for commonly needed reports.  These templates
can be xref:_cloning_a_report_template[cloned] and used as is or xref:_modifying_report_templates[modified]
by library staff.  Library staff can also xref:_creating_report_templates[create new report templates]; 
successfully creating a new template generally requires a solid understanding of Evergreen and 
the xref:_the_evergreen_database[Evergreen database]. 

When a xref:_running_a_report[report is run] Evergreen looks at the values defined for the filters in the 
report definition and then goes through the database and gathers the records that meet the conditions 
into an output file. The output file can be viewed xref:_viewing_output_via_the_reporter[via the reporter 
within the staff client] or via the xref:_viewing_output_via_the_email_link[link in the report completion 
email].

Any staff needing to view report output, but not run reports, must sign and submit the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/all-staff-reporter-privacy-waiver/[All 
Staff Reporter Privacy Waiver].  Once the waiver is completed, if the staff account meets the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[required criteria],
Co-op Support will grant report output viewing permissions to the account.
