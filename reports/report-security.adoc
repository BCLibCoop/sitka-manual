Reporter Security Measures

(((Permissions, Reporter)))

Evergreen has a powerful reportering that report on almost every field in every table in the Evergreen database.

In accordance with Sitka’s privacy policy and owing to the nature of Sitka’s shared Evergreen database there are several
measures in place to help libraries protect their patron data.

Reporter Privacy Waivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any library staff needing access to the reporter must sign and submit the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/full-reporter-privacy-waiver/[Full 
Reporter Privacy Waiver].  Once the waiver is completed, if the staff account meets the 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[required criteria],
Co-op Support will grant reporter permissions to the account. 

Library directors and administrators should ensure that only appropriate staff at their library have access to the
reporter.  The report template xref:_staff_assigned_to_supplementary_permission_group_s[Staff Assigned to Supplementary
Permission Group(s)] can be used to see what staff have additional permission groups, such as reporter permissions, assigned.


Accessing Report Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Report templates, definitions, and output can be shared between library staff. 

Two things must be in place for sharing to work:

. The folder containing the template, definition, or output must be xref:_sharing_folders[shared with the appropriate 
organization].
. The viewing staff member must have signed a 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[reporter privacy waiver] and been granted 
either _Reporter Full Permissions_ or _Reporter View Output Permissions_.

[NOTE]
======
It may be useful for staff to share report templates between libraries.

There are very few circumstances 
where it would be appropriate to share report definitions or output between libraries.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Redaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Personal information is defined by FIPPA as information about an identifiable person. Examples include, 
but are not limited to: name, age, address, phone number, and email address.

Patron PII will only display in report output if the staff member requesting the report has the appropriately scoped 
permissions to see the patron's information based on that staff's set of working locations and permission depth, or 
the patron has opted-in to be visible at such a location. 

If report output contains patron PII for patrons outside of the staff member running the report's library, the PII 
will be redacted and display as blank field. 

The below example shows a report run by a staff member at Maple Public Library.

* PII shows for the three Maple patrons - Ashley, James, and Bart.
* PII shows for the one Arbutus patron who has opted in at Maple - Jules.
* PII does not show for the other Arbutus patron who has not opted in at Maple.
