Before creating a completely new template Co-op Support 
recommends checking the xref:_shared_sitka_templates[Sitka_templates] to see if there is a template that 
can be modified to give you the information you need.

Creating a template is complex and requires some understanding of the Evergreen database and how 
Evergreen handles various records when performing tasks on the staff client. It can be useful to plan 
out your template before getting started with the reporter.  Think about what type of records you will
be reporting on (circulation, item, bibliographic, patron, etc.) and what information you want to see
displayed in your report output.  You also want to think about what filters should be used so the report 
output contains only the records you're interested in.

. Go to *Administration -> Reports*. 
. In the _My Folders_ section select the caret beside the _Templates_ folder to see your template folders. 
Use the carets to expand the folder tree until you find the folder where you'd like to create
the new template.
. Select the folder name.

the editor.

. Choose a Core Source. See xref:_source[].
. Add Display Fields. See xref:_adding_a_display_field[].
. Add Filters. See xref:_adding_a_filter[].
+
[CAUTION]
=========
All report templates MUST have at least one filter to choose a specific library.  This filter is important as it allows 
staff to comply with Sitka's data use requirements as per https://librariescoop.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/Board/EbkI4ll_0ydEifawYC3l9ScBVAh3SqcfkrMUbBHWzzm-Bg?e=5wD8Q5[Appendix J of the Service Management Agreement] and restrict the data in the report output to only data relevant 
to their library.
=========
+
. Add hardcoded filter values for any filters that should always use the same value.  See 
xref:_report_filters[] for a list of filters that are commonly hardcoded.
. Click *Save*.
. Your new template can now be found in the folder you saved it in.
. xref:_running_a_report[Run a report] from the new template to see if the desired output is generated.
+
[TIP]
=====
If the path for one of your display fields or filters is incorrect you will get an error instead of the 
expected report output. Sometimes the error text will give you a clue about what isn't working.

You can modify your template and try again or contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] 
for assistance.  Please review xref:_troubleshooting_report_templates[] before creating a ticket to ensure 
you include all the information needed for Co-op Support to assist you.
=====
+
. Repeat the above steps until your template works as desired.

[NOTE]
======
It is not unusual to create multiple versions of a template when working to modify a template.  Once you
have a template that works as desired Co-op Support recommends deleting the interim versions of the template.
See xref:_deleting_a_report_template[].
