Creating Templates
------------------

Once the folders are ready, you can create or clone a template. Templates allow you to run a report more than 
once, without building it anew every time by changing definitions (such as values for the filters) to suit 
current requirements. For example, a template counting patrons with a registration date within a time frame 
can be used to find out the number of patrons registered within the last month or the last ten days. Another 
example is a shared template that reports on circulation statistics at a given library. This can be used by 
other libraries by selecting their own library as the circulating library when they run the report.
 
Creating a template is complex. It requires some understanding of the Evergreen database and how Evergreen 
handles various records when performing tasks on the staff client. You may refer to the last section of this 
chapter for some background knowledge. Bear in mind that a template includes a list of displayed fields, 
the information you will see in the result, and a list of filter fields which enables you to set up the 
conditions for your target records. Generally you do not record your specific conditions in the template. For example, 
in an overdue template, you do not record 2012-01-01 as the due date. Instead, you just make the Due Date 
field in the circulation record as a filter field. When setting up the report with this template, you will 
be given the chance to put in 2012-01-01 as the due date.
 
It can be useful to plan out your report on paper before getting started with the reporting tool. The first 
thing to decide is the source table. You can choose only one starting source table for each template. If 
you need information from other tables, follow the link in the source table to those tables. Grouping together 
related fields and identifying the key fields will help you select the correct source.
 
We will take a report on circulation statistics as an example to show you how to create a template. In 
circulation statistic reports, libraries usually want to know how many items were checked out within a 
selected time period (in fact how many times items were checked out). When an item is checked out on the staff client, a record is created in the circulation 
table. You want a count of the number of circulation records created within the time period. So, the 
Circulation table is likely the source with which you want to start.
 
You may wish to break down the number of circulations by items' shelving locations to see the circulations by 
different types of materials (or the patrons' profile groups). In this case, the count of circulation records 
and the shelving location (or patron profile) are the potential displayed fields. For the filter fields, you 
need to limit the circulations done within a time period, so checkout date should be a filter. You 
want to count the circulations done at your library only as you are part of a consortium, or for all the 
branches of your library system. (In such a case, you may want to see the checkout library in the result, 
too.) So, the circulating library will be another filter.
 
With the above analysis, we will build the template from scratch in the following section to demonstrate 
the procedure on the template creating screen.
 

Choosing Displayed Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Click on the My Folder template folder where you want the template to be saved.
. Click on *Create a new Template for this folder*.
+
image::images/report/template-1.png[]
+
. You can now see the template creating interface. The three columns below the template name and description are for database source table, fields in the selected table and available transform for the selected field. You select fields for your template here. The lower portion is the selected displayed fields and fitlers in the template.
+
image::images/report/template-2.png[]
+ 
We will select the displayed fields for our template first. So make sure Displayed Fields is selected.
+
The top left hand pane contains the database Core Sources drop-down list. This is the list of tables available 
as a starting point for your template. Commonly used sources are Circulation (contains circulation records 
that may be used for circulation statistics and overdue reports), ILS User (contains patron records that 
may be used for patron reports), and Item (contains copy records that may be used for reports on collection 
or items with special status).
+
image::images/report/template-3.png[]
+
The Nullability checkbox beside the sources list is for specifying the join type between 
linked source tables. In most cases, it should be left unchecked by default.  For  details refer to the tip xref:nullability_commonly_used_tables[] for how to use Nullability checkbox.
+
. Select Circulation in the Sources dropdown menu. Note that the Core Sources for reporting are listed first, 
however it is possible to access all available sources at the bottom of this dropdown menu.
+
CAUTION: One template can have only one starting source table. If you need information from other tables 
you should follow the links made by the Reports interface to those tables. The reporting program can not 
put two pieces of isolated information together into one record in the result. When you change a starting 
table all your existing selected fields will be removed.
+
. Click on Circulation to retrieve all the fields, which will be displayed in the middle column. 
+
image::images/report/template-4.png[]
+
. When you select a field in the middle column, the available data transforms of the selected field are 
displayed in the right column. Transforms specify how data should be processed before they are 
displayed/compared. Fields may contain different types of data, indicated by the little icon in front of each field. Different data types may be transformed differently. Refer to xref:template_terminology[] for details of transforms for each data type. 
+
For our example template, select Circ ID in the middle column, and Count Distinct from the 
right Transform column. We are counting the number of circulation records.
+
. Click *Add Fields* to add this field to your report output. 
Note that Circ ID now shows up at the bottom under Displayed Fields tab.
+
image::images/report/template-5.png[]
+
. Circ ID will be the column header in the report output. You can rename default display names 
to something more meaningful. To do so in this example, select the Circ ID row and click *Actions* -> *Change Column Label*. Type in a new name, "Circ Count", then click *OK/Continue* on the prompt.
+
image::images/report/template-6.png[]
+
. Add other data to your report by going back to the Source area and selecting the desired fields. 
In this example, we are going to add Circulating Item's Shelving Location to further refine the 
circulation report.
+
Shelving Location is listed in the Circulation table. But the icon in front it indicates it is link, which means it is an ID from another table. It is meaningless to most users. We need to display shelving location's name. We will follow the link to Shelving Location table to select Name field. Click the arrow in fron of Circulation in the left table column to display the linked tables. 
+
image::images/report/template-7.png[]
+
. Click on Shelving Location in the table list.

. In the middle Field column, select *Name*.
 
. In the right Transform column, select Raw Data and click *Add Fields*. Use Raw Data when you do not wish to transform field data in any manner.
+
image::images/report/template-8.png[]
+ 
. *Name* will appear in the bottom Displayed Fields tab. Select the Name row and click *Actions* -> *Change Column Label* to the field name to Shelving Location. 
+
NOTE: In the left Source Path column, *(inner)* indicates the join type between Circulation and Shelving Location table is inner join.
+
. Note that the order of rows (top to bottom) will correspond to the order of columns (left to right) on the final report. The results will be sorted by the columns in this order, too. Select Shelving location and click on *Actions* -> *Move Field Up* to move Shelving location before Circ Count. The result will be sorted by Shelving Location first.
 
. Return to the Sources area to add more fields to your template. Under Sources click Circulation, then select Check Out Date/Time from the middle Field column.
 
. Select Year + Month in the right hand Field Transform column and click Add Fields
 
. Check Out Date/Time will appear in the Displayed Fields tab. In the report it will appear as a year and month (YYYY-MM) corresponding to the selected transform.
 
. Select the Check Out Date/Time row. Click *Actions* -> *Change Column Label* to change the column header to *Check out month*.
 
. Move Check out month to the top of the list using *Actions* -> *Move Field Up*, so that it will be the first column in an MS Excel spreadsheet. Now, the report output will sort by the checkout month first, then by shelving locations.
+

TIP: Note that field transform can be changed after fields being added. Use the function on the Actions list.
 
Applying Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without filters, all records in the database will be in the result, which is seldom desired, especially 
in Sitka's context where libraries share the same database. So some filters should be applied to keep 
out the unwanted records.
 
The following procedure shows how to add filters to the example template:
 
. Select the Filters tab at the bottom.
. For this circulation statistics example, select Circulation table, Check Out Date/Time field and Year + Month in transform column,then click on Add Fields. We are going to filter on the checkout month.
+
image::images/report/template-10.png[]
+  
. Note that the default operator for the filter is Equal. It may be changed. Select Check Out Date/Time row. Click on *Actions* -> *Change Operator* and select *In list* from the dropdown menu in the popup window. This operator allows you to count circulations done within each month for several months by just one report.
+
image::images/report/template-11.png[]
image::images/report/template-12.png[]
+ 
. To filter on the location of the circulation, select Circulation table, Circulating library field and Raw Data transform, and 
click on Add Fields.
. Note that this is a template, so the value for this filter may be filled out when you run the report. 
+
For multi-branch libraries, you may want to change the operator to In List so that you could 
specify multiple branch(es) when you run the report.
. You may add a hint to the filter, e.g. explaining the function of the filter, what value is expected when 
setting up the report, etc. Select the filter and click *Actions* -> *Change Column Documentation* to change field hint.
+
In the above example, we added some instruction on how to fill up the filter when setting up the report. 
The hint will show up on the report creation screen. Below is how it looks like on the report creation screen.
+
image::images/report/template-13.png[]
+
. Once you have configured your template, you must name and save it. Name this template Circulations by Months. You also need to add a description. Click *Save Template*.
. You will get a confirmation dialogue box that the template was successfully saved. Click *OK/Continue*.
 
Once a template is saved, it can not be edited anymore. To make changes you will need to clone it and edit 
the clone. This will ensure that the work you have done will not be lost. As mentioned before, creating a 
template is complex. The first try seldom gets the perfect result. Your subsequent changes may not always 
improve the result. You may need to refer back to your old version. Make changes step-by-step. Check the 
correctness of the result on each step. This may help you to find out the exact cause of the issue. After 
you have the desired template, you may delete all the interim ones.
 
The above paragraphs described how to create a template from scratch with a very simple example. You may 
choose instead to use one of the generic templates created by the Sitka team to meet common reporting needs. 
(see xref:_shared_sitka_templates[]). However, knowing how a template is created will help 
you understand the report structure and is recommended as an introduction to editing template fields and 
filters.
