Generating Reports from Templates
---------------------------------

Now you are ready to run a report from the template you have created.
 
. Find the template you just created in the Template folder. In the My Folders section, click the arrow 
next to *Templates* to expand this folder and select *Circulation*.
. Select the checkbox in front of *Circulations by Months*. Select *Create a new report from selected 
template* from the dropdown menu. Click *Submit*.

.. Template Name, Template Creator, and Template Description are for informational purposes only. They are hard 
coded when the template is created. At the report definition stage it is not possible to change them.
.. Report Name is required. Reports stored in the same folder must have unique names.
.. Report Description is optional, but may help distinguish among similar reports.
.. Report Columns lists the columns that will appear in the output. This is derived from the template and cannot 
be changed during the report definition.
.. Pivot Label Column and Pivot Data Column are optional. Pivot tables are a different way to view data. If you 
currently use pivot tables in MS Excel it is better to select an Excel output and continue using pivot tables 
in Excel. Please note that Pivot tables are suitable to some result data only.
.. You must choose a report folder to store this report definition. Only report folders under My Folders are 
available. Click on the desired folder to select it.
. Select values for the Circulation > Check Out Date/Time. Use the calendar widget or manually enter the 
desired dates (always in YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD format), then click Add to include the date on the list. 
You may add multiple dates with an InList operator by repeating the above step.
+
The Transform for this field is Year + Month, so even if you choose a specific date (2009-10-20) it will 
appear as the corresponding month only (2009-10).
 
. Select a value for the Circulating Library. 
. Complete the bottom portion of the report definition interface, then click Save.
.. Select one or more output formats. In this example the report output will be available as an Excel 
spreadsheet, an HTML table (for display in the staff client or browser), and as a bar chart. Please note 
that charts are suitable to some result data only.
.. If you want the report to be recurring, check the box and select the Recurrence Interval as described in xref:_running_recurring_reports[].  In this example, as this is a report that will only be run once, the Recurring Report 
box is not checked.
.. Select *Run as soon as possible* for immediate output. It is also possible to set up reports that run 
automatically in the future.
.. It is optional to fill out an email address where a completion notice can be sent. The email will contain 
a link to a password-protected report output (staff login required). If you have an email address in your account, it will automatically appear in the email notification box.  However, 
you can enter a different email address or multiple addresses separated by commas.
.. Select a folder for the report's output.
. You will get a confirmation dialogue box that the Action Succeeded. Click OK.
 
Once saved, reports stay there forever unless you delete them. When a report is deleted all the linked output 
files will be deleted, too.
 
Report files are viewable and editable (recurring report only). You may view the contents of a report. 
You can generate a new report based on the past report file or re-schedule a recurring report. See xref:edit_reports[] for details.
 
[TIP]
=====
* The required value for filters should be in a format corresponding to the data transform. For example, 
for a call number field transformed to First Continuous Non-space string, you need to put in the call 
number prefix; for a field transformed to Count you need to give an integer. See Template Terminology 
section for more on Data Transforms.
*Action corresponds to Operator used for filter fields. It specifies how the given value will be compared 
with the field value. See Template Terminology section for more on Operators.
*When creating a report, you may disable an unwanted filter in the template by choosing an appropriate 
value for it. For example, if a template lists items created within a time frame, specify a time frame 
between "1900-01-01" and "today" to cover the whole collection; select all copy statuses on the list to 
bypass the filter on item status.
*If the calendar widget is not provided for a date filter, key in the date in format yyyy-mm-dd.
