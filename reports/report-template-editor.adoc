The report template editor is made up of three section:

. Basic Information
. Display field and filter options and selections.
.. *Source*
.. Available fields from selected *Source*.
.. Fields selected for inclusion in template and modifying information
. *Display Fields*, *Filters*, and *Report Layout* tabs

Basic Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _Basic Information_ section of the report template editor is where you can add or update the *Template Name*, *Template Description*, and *Documentation URL*.

When cloning an existing template these fields will be auto-populated with the values from the original 
template and (clone) will be added to the end of the template name. You can edit the data in these fields as needed.

[NOTE]
======
The names of templates in a folder must be unique.  Evergreen will not allow a template using an identical name to be saved into the same folder.
======

If you have local documentation online that pertains to a report you can add it in the _Documentation URL_
field and it will be included as a link in the report output.


Display Field and Filter Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Report Templates, Display Fields)))
(((Reporter, Display Fields)))
(((Display Fields, Reports)))
(((Report Templates, Filter)))

The *Display Field* and *Filters* selection area is where you build and modify the template columns, data filters, and report layout.

[[_source]]
Report Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Source)))
(((Reporter, Source)))
(((Report Templates, Source)))

Every report template starts with a *Source*.  This is the database table from which your template is
built out. The drop-down menu displays as _Select Source_ when a new template is first created. Selecting a *Source* will cause the rest of the display field and filter selections area to populate.

image::images/report/report-source-1.png[]

When modifying a template NEVER change the core source.  This will scrap your existing template and you
will have to start again from scratch.

When creating a new template the first thing you need to do is figure out which core source makes
the most sense for the data you want to see in your report output. If you need information from 
other tables you'll follow the links to those tables when adding display fields and filters. *Sources* are divided in the drop-down menu into _Core sources_ and _Other sources_. Most standard statistics reports will be created with _Core Sources_ as these represent the primary database tables. The _Other sources_ are less frequently used tables or specially created data views.

The three most commonly used _Core sources_ are _Circulation_, _Item_, and _ILS User_.  Templates for monthly circulation statistics and templates for tracking overdue items use the core source Circulation.  Templates about the state of your collection use the course source Item.  Templates containing counts or lists of your patrons use the core source ILS User.  More information can be found in 
xref:_commonly_used_tables[].

You can link to other database tables to include information contained in those tables but
not every table links directly.  For example, patrons and items aren't directly linked to each other.
Information about items out to a patron is held in the circulation table while information about
items on hold is held in the hold request table.  More information can be found in 
xref:_the_evergreen_database[].

////
Nullability
^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Nullability)))
(((Reporter, Nullability)))
(((Report Templates, Nullability)))

You may wish to use nullability if your report output includes null values that you don't want included. A _NULL_ value in a field means that there is no value in that field. 

Nullability allows you to have more control over whether or not null values in fields are included in your report output.  It does this 
by allowing you to manually select the way in which Evergreen is joining the database tables when running 
a report from the template.  The type of join used will determine what kind of data 
can display a null value in your report output.

When Nullability is checked the following options show for joins between tables:

* *Default* - defined within Evergreen. See xref:_the_evergreen_database[] for more information.
* *Child Nullable* = depends on the default join (usually left). Evergreen will include all records in
the child table (linked to table).
* *Parent Nullable* = depends on the default join (usually right). Evergreen will include all records in
the parent table (linked from table).
* *None Nullable* = equivalent to inner join. Evergreen will only include data that is in both tables


image::images/report/report-nullability-2.png[]

[NOTE]
======
You must use the same nullability selection on all display fields and filters that you add from
the same table.
======

To learn more about nullability see the Evergreen conference presentation https://youtu.be/oDtjpW3Kiz8[*Thanks for Nothing: 
Nullability Selection in Evergreen Reports (45:00)*].

Adding a Display Field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Add, Report Display Field)))
(((Report Templates, Display Fields)))
(((Reporter, Display Fields)))
(((Display Fields, Reports)))

Display fields are the columns which will display in your report output. The *Display Fields* tab is the active tab by default in the Report Template Editor.

. Ensure the *Display Fields* tab is the active tab in the *Display Field, Filters and Report Layout*
 section of the _Report Template Editor_.
. Select the top of the tree in the _Source_ pane.  A list of available fields be displayed in the _All Fields_ pane to the right under the *Display Fields* tab.
+
image::images/report/report-add-display-field-1.png[]
+
. The word in parentheses beside the field name indicates the xref:_data_types[data type].  If the field you want to 
use is a Link you need to expand the tree in the _Source_ pane to find it and then click on it.
+
image::images/report/report-add-display-field-2.png[]
+
. Select the field in the _Source Path_ pane you would like to add as a display field.
+
[NOTE]
======
For display fields you generally want to pick a Text field over an ID or Org_unit field. For example,
to add Call Number as a dislay field you will select on *Call Number Label* rather than *Call Number/Volume ID*.
======
+
image::images/report/report-add-display-field-3.png[]
+
. In the _Field Display Order_ pane select on the xref:_field_transforms[transform] you would like to use.  The transforms
available in the list will vary depending on the xref:_data_types[data type] of the selected field.
.. The transform will determine how Evergreen processes the data when generating the report. Raw data 
is the most commonly used transform for display fields except when it's a timestamp in which case _Date_
is more commonly used.  More information on the available transforms can be found in 
xref:_field_transforms[].
+
image::images/report/report-add-display-field-4.png[]

Adding a Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Add, Report Filter)))
(((Report Templates, Filter)))
(((Reporter, Filter)))
(((Filter, Reports)))

Filters allow you to set up the criteria so that Evergreen returns the information you are looking for.
In most cases the value for the filter will be entered when the report is run, rather than included
in the template.

. Select the *Filters* tab as the active tab in the *Display Field, Filters and Report Layout* section of 
the _Report Template Editor_.
. Select the top of the tree in the _Source_ pane.  A list of available fields will be displayed under _All Fields_ pane.
+
image::images/report/report-add-filter-field-1.png[]
+
. The word in parentheses beside the field name indicates the xref:_data_types[data type].  If the field you want to 
use is a Link you need to expand the tree in the _Source_ pane to find it and then select it.
. Select the field in the _All Fields_ pane you would like to add as a filter.
+
[NOTE]
======
For filters you generally want to pick an ID or Org_unit field over a Text field. For example,
to add circulating library as a filter you will select *Circulating Library* which is labeled an Org_unit.
======
+
image::images/report/report-add-filter-field-2.png[]
+
. In the _Filter Fields and Values_  area select the xref:_field_transforms[transform] you would like to use.  The transforms
available in the list will vary depending on the xref:_data_types[data type] of the selected field.
+
[NOTE]
======
The transform will determine how Evergreen processes the data when generating the report. Raw data 
is the most commonly used transform for filters except when it's a timestamp in which case Date or
Month + Year is more commonly used.  More information on the available transforms can be found in 
xref:_field_transforms[].
======
+
. If desired, you can hardcode the value of the filter into the template.  
See xref:_updating_a_filter_value[].
. Select the Operator. See xref:_operators[].

Display fields are the columns of information that will display on your report output.  The *Display
Fields* tab is the active tab by default in the _Report Template Editor_.

[NOTE]
======
The action *Change Column Documentation* on the *Display Fields* tab can be ignored as it does not
apply to display fields.
======

[[_reordering_display_fields]]
Reordering Display Fields
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

. You can use the arrows on the right to move fields up and down the list. The list order top to bottom here on the _Display Fields_ tab will determine the order of column display from left to right. Sorting is controlled separately, in the *Report Layout* tab.
+
image::images/report/report-reorder-display-field-1.png[]
+
. Repeat until your fields are in the order you desire.

[[_renaming_a_display_field]]
Renaming a Display Field
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each dislay field in a template has a column label which displays as the column header in the report output.

. On the *Display Fields* tab you can adjust the display name of any field by clicking in the *Name* box and typing in a new name. The original field name will show below the *Name* box along with the path you took to field the field starting at your source.
+
image::images/report/report-display-name-1.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
It is best practice to include qualifiers in the field names for fields like barcode and library so that 
staff know what data they are looking at in the report output.

For example, for multi-branch libraries and libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing it is not uncommon for the
Circulating Library and Owning Library of an item to be different.  In this case it is important to specify
in the field name which type of library is being presented in the report output data.

For information on specific transforms see xref:_field_transforms[].

. On the *Display Fields* you can adjust the way data will display in your output by using the Transform dropdown on each selected field. Transform options will vary depending on the fields you have selected, and in some cases will default to a specific recommended transform value (e.g., fields that total payments will default to a transform of “Sum”).

Removing a Display Field
++++++++++++++++++++++++

[CAUTION]
=========
Removing display fields usually does not affect the result set for the report output but it can, especially
when the report output displays a count of records (whether item, patron, circulation, hold, or bibliographic).

When removing fields be mindful of whether or not it will still be clear in the report output what your results
mean. 
=========

. On the *Display Fields* you can remove a field by clicking the minus button on the left of this area. You can also remove a field by unchecking it from the options under the All Fields header.

[[_changing_the_column_documentation]]
Changing the Column Documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When running a report the filter can include text which gives information on how to use the particular filter and
in some cases how to enter the filter value.  In the _Report Template Editor_ this is referred to as column
documentation or a field hint.

image::images/report/report-filters-1.png[]

. On the *Filter* tab select the field you would like to add column documentation to.
. Select the *Supply Hint* box.
+
image::images/report/report-filters-2.png[]
+
. Enter the hint text in the newly displayed field.
+
image::images/report/report-filters-3.png[]

[[_updating_a_filter_value]]
Updating a Filter Value
+++++++++++++++++++++++

(((Report Templates, Filter Value)))
(((Reporter, Filter Value)))
(((Filter Value, Reports)))

Filter values can be hardcoded into a template or left blank to be filled in when the report is run.  Information
on commonly hardcoded filters can be found in xref:_report_filters[].

Hardcoding a filter is recommend when the value of the filter will not change.  For example, hardcoded filters
are often used when filtering out deleted items.

Filter values can also be hardcoded into templates to make it easier for staff with less reporter experience to
run certain reports.  For example, you can set up a report with a Item Status filter with a hardcoded value 
of _Missing_ so that staff can run a report to get a list of all missing items without having to enter filter 
information.  

Co-op Support recommends balancing the re-usabilty of templates that comes when staff enter filter values at the time of
running a report versus the ease of use for staff with less experience with the reporter.  For example, when no value is
entered in the template for a filter on Item Status staff can pick the relevant status from the 26 statuses currently 
in use in Sitka's Evergreen.  When a value is hardcoded in for item status a new template must be created everytime you wish
to filter on a different item status.


. On the *Filter* tab, locate the field you would like add, update, or remove the filter value for.
. To add a value,
.. Select the *Supply Filter Value* checkbox beneath the field’s *Transform* field. A new set of options for *Filter value* will be displayed under the *Operator* field. The particular filter mechanism will vary depending on your selected *Transform* and *Operator*. See Filter Values for details on exactly how different values must be entered.
. To edit a preexisting value, overwrite the current *Filter Value* with your desired value.
. To remove an existing hardcoded value, deselect the *Supply Filter Value* checkbox. Filter values will instead need to be added at the report definition level.
+
image::images/report/report-filters-value-1.png[]


[[_removing_a_filter]]
Removing a Filter
+++++++++++++++++

[CAUTION]
=========
Removing a filter WILL affect what results are included in your report output.  Ensure you don't need to filter
on a particular field before removing it.

All report templates MUST have at least one filter to choose a specific library. This filter is important as it allows 
staff to comply with Sitka's data use requirements as per 
https://ln.sync.com/dl/ca731e4e0/view/doc/7839812630003#bw5v92du-w6q5j6uj-szy6shez-smwueqdv[Appendix J 
of the Service Management Agreement] and restrict the data in the report output to only data relevant 
to their library.
=========

. On the *Filter* tab select the filter field you would like to remove.
. You can remove a field by clicking the *minus* button on the left of this area. You can also remove a field by unchecking it from the options under the All Fields header..
+
image::images/report/report-filters-remove-1.png[]
+
. The selected field is removed and no longer shows as a filter field.

Template Report Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Select the *Report Layout* tab to adjust the organization of the data on your final output.
 
. On the left side, under _Field Display Order_, you can rename columns, adjust transforms, and reorder your columns 
in this tab in the same way you can in the _Field Display_ tab.
. On the right side, under _Field Sort Order_, you can independently set sort orders on each column as well 
as determine which column should sort first, second, third, etc. The sorting is independent of the column display order.
+
image::images/report/report-template-layout-1.png[]

In the example above, the first three columns to display will be Shelving Location, Owning Library, and then Circulating Library, but the report will sort first by Count of Circulations, then Checkout Month, and then by Shelving Location.



Template Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Reporter, Template Terminology)))
(((Report Templates, Terminology)))

Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^

(((Data Types)))
(((Reporter, Data Types)))
(((Report Templates, Data Types)))


Every field that display in _display field and filter options_ area of the Report Template Editor is associated with a data 
type. This indicates what kind of information is stored in the field and Evergreen will handle the information 
differently based on the data type. Each data type has its own characteristics and uses. The type of data will be listed next to the field name in parentheses.

[options="header"]
|===
|Data Type |Description    |Notes
|Boolean |Contains either "true" or "false".    |Examples in Evergreen: "deleted" in item/patron record, "circulate?" in item record.
|ID |Unique number assigned by the database to identify a record    |IDs look like numbers, but the ID 
data type is treated specially by the software for determining how tables are linked. ID is a good candidate field for counting records.
|Integer |A number like 1, 2, 3.    |Examples in Evergreen: "remaining renewal count" in circulation record, "claimed returned count" in patron record.
|Interval |Time intervals, such as "2 weeks" and "6 months"    |Examples in Evergreen: "loan duration" and "grace period" in circulation record,
|Link |It is similar to the id data type. It is the id of a record in another table.    |Examples in Evergreen: "user id" and "item id" in a circulation record. Link outputs a number that is a meaningful reference for the database but not of much use to a human user. You will usually want to drill further down the tree in the Sources pane and select fields from the linked table. However, in some instances you might want to use a link field. For example, to count the number of patrons who borrowed items you could do a count on the "user id" in the circulation record.
|Money |Monetary amount    |Examples in Evergreen: "price" in item record, "billing amount" in billing record.
|Org_unit |Organizational unit. It is a number. It acts like link data type.    |In Evergreen, libraries are organizational units. In Sitka context they are organized into a tree structure with consortium, library federations, libraries/library systems and branches for library systems. To filter on a library, make sure you choose the field having org_unit data type. To display a library, it is a better option to drill down to the org unit record to display the "name" of it.
|Text |Text field. Usually it takes whatever is typed into the field.    |Examples: "call number label" in call number record, "patron's names".
|Timestamp |A very detailed time such as 2018-11-25 17:54:26-07    |Example: checkout time in circulation record, last status date in item record.
|===

Field Transforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Transform)))
(((Reporter, Transform)))
(((Report Templates, Transform)))

Transforms determine how data is processed when it is retrieved from the database. Different data types can
be transformed differently. Not all transforms are available to a certain data type.

This table lists the commonly used transforms.  Some data types, like timestamp, will have additional 
transforms available when adding fields or filters to a template.

[options="header"]
|===
|Transform |Applicable Data Types |Description | Notes
|Raw Data |All Data Types |To display the data exactly as it is stored in the database. | Most commonly used
transform 
|Date |Timestamps |  This transform presents a timestamp as a human-readable date in yyyy-mm-dd format. |For example,
timestamp 2018-11-25 17:54:26-07 will be displayed as 2018-11-25. 
|Year + Month |Timestamps | Presents a timestamp as the year and month in yyyy-mm format. |For example, 2018-11-25
17:54:26-07 will be displayed as 2018-11. If filtering on a timestamp transformed to Year + Month, all
days in the calendar month are included. 
|Upper Case |Text | Transforms text to all upper case. |
|Lower Case |Text | Transforms text to all lower case. |
|Substring |Text | This transform can be applied to filters, not display fields. It matches the given value with a
continuous string of characters in the field. |For example, if a given value is "123" and the match is with a
call number field, call numbers like "123.34", "ANF 123.34", "JNF 233.123", etc. will be in the result list.
|First Continuous Non-space string |Text |  The first word (or string of numbers and/or characters until the first
spacing) in a field is returned by this transform. |For example, this transform will return "E" from text
"E DOR", "E 123", etc. 
|Count |Text, Integer, ID, Money, Timestamp, Org_unit |  This transform counts the records found. |Though you can count 
by any field, very often id field is used. 
|Count Distinct |Text, Integer, ID, Money, Timestamp, Org_unit | This transform counts the number of records 
with unique value in the field. If two records
have the same value in the field, they will be counted once only. |A typical example of using Count Distinct
is counting the number of active patrons who borrowed items at a library. Each patron can be counted once
only but he/she may borrow multiple items. Transforming the patron id in circulation record with Count
Distinct will result in the required number. Since each patron has a unique id, she/her will be counted once
only. 
|Max |Text, Integer, Money, and Timestamp | It compares the values in the field of all result records and then 
returns the one record with the highest value. For timestamp the highest value means
the latest date. |For example, if a checkout date is transformed by Max, the returned date is the last checkout
date.
|Min |Text, Integer, Money, and Timestamp | It works the same way as Max except that it returns the lowest value. |
|===

Operators
^^^^^^^^^

(((Operator)))
(((Reporter, Operator)))
(((Report Templates, Operator)))

Operators describe how two pieces of data can be compared to each other. They are used when creating filters
in a template to determine which records should be included in the result. The record is included when the
comparison returns "TRUE". The possible ways of comparing data are related to data type and data transforms.
The available operators are:

[options="header"]
|===
|Operator |Description    |Notes
|Equals | Compares two operands and returns TRUE if they are exactly the same. |
|Contains Matching Substring | This operator checks if any part of the field matches the given parameter. |It is
case-sensitive.
|Contains Matching Substring (Ignore Case) | This operator is identical to Contains Matching Substring, except
it is not case-sensitive. |
|Greater Than | This operator returns TRUE if a field is greater than your parameter. For text fields, the
string is compared character by character in accordance with the general rule that numerical characters are
smaller than alphabetical characters and upper case alphabeticals are smaller than lower case alphabeticals |For timestamps "Greater Than" can be thought of as "later than" or "after".
|Greater than or equal to |This operator returns TRUE if a field is greater than or equal to your 
parameter. For text fields, the string is compared character by character in accordance with the general 
rule that numerical characters are smaller than alphabetical characters and upper case alphabeticals 
are smaller than lower case alphabeticals |For timestamps "Greater Than or equal to" can be thought of as 
"later than or equal to" or "after or equal to".
|Less Than | This operator returns TRUE if a field is less than, lower than, earlier than or smaller than your
parameter. |
|In List| It is similar to Equals, except it allows you specify multiple parameters and returns "TRUE" if the
field is equal to any one of the given values. |
|Not In List |  It is the opposite of In List. Multiple parameters can be specified. TRUE will be returned only
when none of the parameters is matched with the value in the field. |
|Between | Two parameters are required by this operator. TRUE is returned when the field value is Greater Than
or Equal to the smaller given value and Less Than or Equal to the bigger given value. The smaller parameter
should always comes first when filling in a filter with this operator. | For example: between 3 and 5 is
correct. Between 5 and 3 will return FALSE on the Reports interface. For timestamp earlier date always comes
first.
|Is NULL | Returns TRUE for fields that contain no data.| For example, an overdue report will include a filter
for Check In Date/Time is NULL as an item is no longer overdue if there is a value for Check In Date/Time.
|Is NULL or Blank | Returns TRUE for fields that contain no data or blank string. For most intents and purposes
this operator should be used when there is no visible value in the field. |
|===



Filter Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Report Templates, Filter Value)))
(((Reporter, Filter Value)))
(((Filter Value, Reports)))

If you enter hardcoded values for filter fields, the data must match exactly how is displays in Evergreen. 
For example, if the status is _Missing_ in Evergreen you must use _Missing_, a value of _missing_ will 
not return results.

If hardcoding a value for a library filter you must use your library's unique Evergreen ID.  Local System Administrators can find this ID by going to Administration -> Server Administration -> Organizational Units.
