Basic Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic information section of the report template editor is where you can update the template name,
description, and documentation URL.

When cloning an existing template these fields will be auto-populated with the values from the original 
template and (clone) will be added to the end of the template name.

If you have local online documentation that pertains to a report you can add it in the Documentation URL
field and it will be included as a link in the report output.


Field and Filter Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The field and filter selector is where you build your display fields and filters for your template.

Core Source
^^^^^^^^^^^

You can not change the starting source table, but have to follow the links to tables in the Sources pane. 
Changing the starting table will remove all existing fields, meaning building a new template from scratch.

Field and Filter Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Display Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Display fields are the columns of information that will display on your report output.  The _Display
Fields_ tab is the active tab by default in the _Report Template Editor_.

[NOTE]
======
The action *Change Column Documentation* on the Display Fields tab can be ignored as it does not
apply to display fields.
======


Reorder Fields
++++++++++++++

. On the _Display Fields_ tab select the field you would like to re-order.
. From the *Actions* menu choose *Move Field Up* or *Move Field Down*.  You can also right-click on the
field to open the *Actions* menu.

Rename a Field
++++++++++++++

The dislay fields in a template have a column label which displays as the column header in report output.

. On the _Display Fields_ tab select the field you would like to rename.
. From the *Actions* menu choose *Change Column Label*. You can also right-click on the
field to open the *Actions* menu.

. The new field name displays in the _Column Label_ column and will display as the column header on your report
output.

[NOTE]
======
It is best practice to include qualifiers in the field names for fields like barcode and library so that 
staff know what data they are looking at in the report output.

For example, for multi-branch libraries and libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing it is not uncommon for the
Circulating Library and Owning Library of an item to be different.  In this case it is important to specify
in the field name which type of library is being presented in the report output data.

Remove a Field
++++++++++++++


Removing displayed fields usually does not affect the result set. But sometimes it does, esp.
 when the report displays the count of records by each group. Sometimes some fields may contain 
 important information. Removing them may cause misunderstanding the results. Usually such fields are 
 explained in the template Description. Be cautious when you delete such fields.
