Report Template Editor
----------------------

The report template editor is made up of three section:

. Basic Information
. Field and Filter Selector
. Field and Filter Display

Basic Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic information section of the report template editor is where you can update the template name,
description, and documentation URL.

When cloning an existing template these fields will be auto-populated with the values from the original 
template and (clone) will be added to the end of the template name.

If you have local online documentation that pertains to a report you can add it in the Documentation URL
field and it will be included as a link in the report output.


Field and Filter Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The field and filter selector is where you build your display fields and filters for your template.

Core Source
^^^^^^^^^^^

You can not change the starting source table, but have to follow the links to tables in the Sources pane. 
Changing the starting table will remove all existing fields, meaning building a new template from scratch.

Add Fields

Field and Filter Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Display Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Display fields are the columns of information that will display on your report output.  The *Display
Fields* tab is the active tab by default in the _Report Template Editor_.

[NOTE]
======
The action *Change Column Documentation* on the *Display Fields* tab can be ignored as it does not
apply to display fields.
======


Reordering  Fields
++++++++++++++++++

. On the *Display Fields* tab select the field you would like to re-order.
. From the *Actions* menu choose *Move Field Up* or *Move Field Down*.  You can also right-click on the
field to open the *Actions* menu.
+

+
. Repeat until your fields are in the order you desire.


Renaming a Field
++++++++++++++++

Each dislay field in a template has a column label which displays as the column header in the report output.

. On the *Display Fields* tab select the field you would like to rename.
. From the *Actions* menu choose *Change Column Label*. You can also right-click on the
field to open the *Actions* menu.

+
. In the pop-up that appears enter the new name for the field and click *OK/Continue*.
+

+
. The new field name displays in the _Column Label_ column and will display as the column header on your report
output.

[NOTE]
======
It is best practice to include qualifiers in the field names for fields like barcode and library so that 
staff know what data they are looking at in the report output.

For example, for multi-branch libraries and libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing it is not uncommon for the
Circulating Library and Owning Library of an item to be different.  In this case it is important to specify
in the field name which type of library is being presented in the report output data.

Removing a Field
++++++++++++++++

[CAUTION]
=========
Removing display fields usually does not affect the result set for the report output but it can, especially
when the report output displays a count of records (whether item, patron, circulation, hold, or bibliographic).

When removing fields be mindful of whether or not it will still be clear in the report output what your results
mean. 
=========

. On the *Display Fields* tab select the field you would like to rename.
. From the *Actions* menu choose *Remove Field*. You can also right-click on the
field to open the *Actions* menu.

. The selected field is removed and no longer shows as a display field.



Filters
^^^^^^^

Changing the Column Documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When running a report the filter can include text which gives information on how to use the particular filter and
in some cases how to enter the filter value.  In the _Report Template Editor_ this is referred to as column
documentation or a field hint.

. On the *Filter* tab select the field you would like to add column documentation to.
. From the *Actions* menu choose *Change Column Documentation*. You can also right-click on the
field to open the *Actions* menu.
+

. In the pop-up that appears add or update the text and click *OK/Continue*.
+

. When running a report the column documentation will display under the filter path.

Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^

Field Transforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Operators
^^^^^^^^^

Operators describe how two pieces of data can be compared to each other. They are used when creating filters
in a template to determine which records should be included in the result. The record is included when the
comparison returns "TRUE". The possible ways of comparing data are related to data type and data transforms.
Below are some commonly used operators.

* *Equals*: Compares two operands and returns TRUE if they are exactly the same.
* *Contains Matching Substring*: This operator checks if any part of the field matches the given parameter. It is
case-sensitive.
* *Contains Matching Substring (Ignore Case)*: This operator is identical to Contains Matching Substring, except
it is not case-sensitive.
* *Greater Than*: This operator returns TRUE if a field is greater than your parameter. For text fields, the
string is compared character by character in accordance with the general rule that numerical characters are
smaller than alphabetical characters and upper case alphabeticals are smaller than lower case alphabeticals; 
for timestamps "Greater Than" can be thought of as "later than" or "after".
* *Greater than or equal to*:
* *Less Than*: This operator returns TRUE if a field is less than, lower than, earlier than or smaller than your
parameter.
* *In List*: It is similar to Equals, except it allows you specify multiple parameters and returns "TRUE" if the
field is equal to any one of the given values.
* *Not In List*:  It is the opposite of In List. Multiple parameters can be specified. TRUE will be returned only
when none of the parameters is matched with the value in the field.
* *Between*: Two parameters are required by this operator. TRUE is returned when the field value is Greater Than
or Equal to the smaller given value and Less Than or Equal to the bigger given value. The smaller parameter
should always comes first when filling in a filter with this operator. For example: between 3 and 5 is
correct. Between 5 and 3 will return FALSE on the Reports interface. For timestamp earlier date always comes
first.
l.

*Is NULL or Blank:*  Returns TRUE for fields that contain no data or blank string. For most intents and purposes
this operator should be used when there is no visible value in the field.

*Contains Matching Substring:*  This operator checks if any part of the field matches the given parameter. It is
case-sensitive.

*Contains Matching Substring (Ignore Case):*  This operator is identical to Contains Matching Substring, except
it is not case-sensitive.
