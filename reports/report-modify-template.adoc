Modifying Report Templates
--------------------------

Report templates can be modified to change how the output displays or what data is gathered for the output.

Co-op Support recommends running a report from the original template to see what output is generated before
modifying a template.

. Start by cloning the template you wish to modify.  Follow steps 1 through 7 in 
xref:_cloning_a_report_template[].
. The _Report Template Editor_ will open.  See xref:_report_template_editor[] for information on using
the editor.
. Make your desired changes.
. Click *Save Template*.
. Your new template can now be found in the folder you saved it in.
. xref:_running_a_report[Run a report] from the new template to see if the desired output is generated.

[TIP]
=====
If the path for one of your display fields or filters is incorrect you will get an error instead of the 
expected report output. Sometimes the error text will give you a clue about what isn't working.

You can modify your template and try again or contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] 
for assistance.  Please review xref:_troubleshooting_report_templates[] before creating a ticket to ensure 
you include all the information needed for Co-op Support to assist you.

. Repeat the above steps until your template works as desired.


[NOTE]
======
It is not unusual to create multiple versions of a template when working to modify a template.  Once you
have a template that works as desired Co-op Support recommends deleting the interim versions of the template.
See xref:_deleting_a_report_template[].

////
Once saved, it is not possible to edit a template. To make changes, clone the template and change the clone.

To modify a template, repeat the steps 1-6 in cloning a template. You will see the template open on Template Creating screen. Here you can add/remove/edit fields as when you create a new template.

To operate on Displayed fields, click Displayed Fields. You will see all the displayed fields. To remove one, highlight it and click *Actions* >
*Remove Selected Field*. You may move a field up or down the list, which will affect the sorting of the
result records. You may also change the column label or the transform of the field by using respective
functions on the Actions list.

[TIP]
=====
* Removing displayed fields usually does not affect the result set. But sometimes it does, esp. when the
report displays the count of records by each group. Sometimes some fields may contain important information.
Removing them may cause misunderstanding the results. Usually such fields are explained in the template
Description. Be cautious when you delete such fields.
* Be careful with editing filter fields, as usually changing a filter makes a difference in the result set.
=====

You may add fields. See xref:_creating_templates[] for details on operating on fields.


CAUTION: You can not change the starting source table, but have to follow the links to tables in the Sources
pane. Changing the starting table will remove all existing fields, meaning building a new template from scratch.
