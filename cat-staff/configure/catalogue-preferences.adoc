.. *Default Search Library* This determines what library is searched from the advanced search screen 
and portal page by default. You can override this setting when you are actually searching by selecting a 
different library. One recommendation is to set the search library to the highest point you would 
normally want to search.
.. *Preferred Library* This determines which library's holdings display first 
in the item grid within a search result and in the Item Table within a record. If 
your preferred library is a descendant of your search library, the item count in 
in the search result will display for both your search library and preferred library.
One recommendation is to set this to your home library so that local counts show
in the search results when you are searching all of Sitka or a particular ILC zone.
.. *Default Search Pane*  You can choose which search pane is loaded by default when 
opening a new catalogue window.  Choose from Keyword Search, Numeric Search, MARC Search, Browse, and Shelf Browse.
.. *Default Sort Order* You can choose what sort order is used by default for sorting your search
results.
.. *Default Limit to Available* When this setting is checked, the _Limit to Available_ checkbox 
in the search form will be checked by default. 
.. *Default Group Formats/Editions* When this setting is checked, the _Group Formats/Editions_ 
checkbox in the search form will be checked by default. 
.. *Search Results Per Page* You can enter the number of search results that display per page.  
We recommend keeping this number under 200. 
.. *Exclude Electronic Resources* When this setting is checked, the _Exclude Electronic Resources_
 checkbox is added to the search form. Note, this does not check the box within the search form by default.
.. *Highlight Search Terms* When this setting is checked, the search terms used in a keyword search
will be highlighted in the search results.
