Library Staff Accounts
----------------------
[[library-staff-accounts]]
[[local-system-administrators]]

In Evergreen library staff accounts are the same as patron accounts with two differences.

. Staff accounts use Main (Profile) Permissions Groups with permissions that give access to 
Evergreen’s staff functions.
. Staff accounts have working locations which tell Evergreen which libraries or branches 
an account can be used at.

[NOTE]
======
When a library staff account expires the staff member is not able to log into the 
Evergreen staff client until their account has been renewed. 
======

There are two kinds of library staff accounts recommended by Co-op Support:

*Staff Specific Accounts*

* Account is specific to a particular staff member and includes their personal details like first 
and last name.
* Account is used for staff functions only, never used for personal borrowing.
* Account can be granted permissions to use the reporter and/or view report output.
* Account can be updated and transferred to a new staff member preserving access to recurring reports
that run from the reporter.  The new user MUST complete a 
 https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[reporter privacy waiver] to comply 
 with Sitka’s privacy policy.
 
[NOTE]
======
Libraries are encouraged to use Staff Specific Accounts for all accounts that need access to the 
reporter in Evergreen to avoid the need to re-set up recurring reports.
======

*Generic Staff Accounts*

* Account is generally specific to a department or function, such as circulation or cataloguing, and is used
by multiple staff members.
* Account name is not tied to a specific person.  For example, Circulation FrontDesk is a commonly used name.
* Account CANNOT be granted permissions to use the reporter or view report output.


*Staff/Personal Accounts - No Longer Recommended*

* Account is specific to a particular staff member and includes their personal details like first 
and last name.
* Account is used both for performing staff functions and for personal borrowing.
* Account can be granted permissions to use the reporter and/or view report output.
* Account CANNOT be transferred to a new staff member as it is linked to personal borrowing data.

[NOTE]
======
Co-op Support now strongly recommends against using Staff/Personal Accounts due to issues that
have arisen when libraries are closing down a staff member's account after they leave the library.
======



Creating Library Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

link:https://youtu.be/8GXNpN-pxiM[*Sitka Training Video - Creating Library Staff Accounts (4:46)*]

To create a new library staff account register your user as you would a patron taking the following 
into consideration:

* It is best practice to use a temporary password and then have your staff reset their password to something 
only they know.
* For an account to be a staff account it needs to have a Main (Profile) Permission Group with library 
staff permissions.  Choose the appropriate permission group for the access the staff member needs.  

[NOTE]
======
The Local System Administrator permission group can only be assigned by Support.  Libraries may create 
an account using any permission group and then submit a request to Support to have the account updated to 
local system administrator. Please include the account's barcode in the request.
======

The table in 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_staff_account_permission_groups.html[Staff Account Permission Groups]
 shows what staff functions different permission groups can perform.

This example shows public library staff permission groups.  A similar list of 
groups is available for each library type. 

Working Locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[[working-locations]]

After creating the account you need to assign a working location:

. Retrieve the account.
. Go to *Other -> User Permission Editor*.
. Select the checkbox(es) in front of the library/branches that you want to assign to the account.
. Scroll down to the bottom to click *Save*.

[CAUTION]
=========
Staff accounts without a working location can not sign into the Evergreen staff client. 
=========

Editing Library Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

link:https://youtu.be/kQ9HD5SFcFU[*Sitka Training Video - Editing Library Staff Accounts (1:08)*]

All library staff members can update their own username, password, and email addresses by logging 
into *My Account* in the public catalogue.  They can use the *Forgot your Password* link on the *My Account* 
login screen as well, as long as their staff account contains a valid email address. Updating your 
staff account in the public catalogue is the same as updating it in the staff client.

[NOTE]
======
Some libraries have disabled editing of email addresses through My Account.
======

Local System Administrators can edit staff accounts in the staff client, with the exception of any LSA staff 
accounts.  For edits to Local System Administrator accounts, other than username, password, or 
email address, contact Support. Please include the account barcode and the changes needed.


Resetting Staff Account Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://youtu.be/YoB-JG6Y9Sk[*Sitka Training Video - Managing Passwords(4:02)*]


Staff passwords can be reset:

* through My Account in your public catalogue.
** Log into *My Account* and using the the _Change_ link found on the *Personal Information* tab of 
*Account Preferences*.
+
https://youtu.be/LprDPIhqN1I[*Sitka Snippet Video - Changing an Existing Password (1:20)*]
+
* through the password reset link in your public catalogue.
** Use the *Forgot Your Password?* link in the *My Account* login screen on your public catalogue. You must have an email 
address recorded in your staff account for this to method to work.
+
https://youtu.be/iJo5ajf-XAA[*Sitka Snippet Video - Resetting a Forgotten Password (2:54)*]
+
* through your account in the staff client by your local system administrator.
** Local system administrators can use the *Send Password Reset Link* button on the *Edit* tab in the patron account in the staff client OR assign a new password to 
staff that are not also local system administrators.

* through a request to https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].
** If you are unable to reset your password using one of the other methods, send in a request to 
Support to have a temporary password assigned and then use the _Change_ link in *My Account*.

[NOTE]
======
Resetting a password by email is disabled for libraries using single sign-on.  If your library uses
single sign-on you will not be able to use the *Forgot Your Password?* link in your public catalogue or the *Send Password Reset Link* button
in the staff client.

Please contact 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] for the password reset URL for your library.
======



Staff Account Permission Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every library staff account must have a staff permission group assigned as their Main (Profile)
Permission Group in order to access the staff client.  Staff can also have secondary permission
groups assigned to give them access to special features.

Library directors should consider what functions each staff member needs access to and 
assign the appropriate permission group.

Granting Additional Permissions to Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional permissions can be granted to library staff in two ways.

Secondary Permission Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

link:https://youtu.be/QgChELUq48E[*Sitka Snippet Video - Additional Permissions for Library Staff Accounts (2:03)*]

Acquisitions and reporter permissions are granted as secondary permission groups.  Acq Admin users can grant 
acquisitions permissions.  Reporter permissions are granted by Co-op Support after a 
https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[Reporter Privacy Waiver] is completed.

The report template _Staff Assigned to Supplementary Permission Group(s)_ can be used to generate a list 
of staff at your library who have a secondary permission group assigned to their account.  This template 
is found under Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Patrons -> Others.


Individual Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local System Administrators may selectively grant additional permissions available to LSA accounts 
to other non-LSA accounts.

In the example below a Circ + Full Cat account is granted permission to process offline transactions, a 
function which otherwise requires an LSA login.

. Log in to Evergreen with a local system administrator account.
. Find the staff acount on *User Permission Editor*. You may search for the patron account, then go to 
*Others -> User Permission Editor*, or go to *Administration -> User Permission Editor* to search for 
the account by barcode.
. When User Permission Editor is loaded, scroll down the permission list to find *OFFLINE_EXECUTE*. 
. Select the checkbox in *Applied* column. 
. Scroll down to the bottom to click *Save*.
+

[TIP]
=====
* *Permission*: List of permission names. For help correlating permissions to specific Evergreen functions 
please contact Support.
* *Applied*: If checked the permission is granted to this account.
* *Depth*:  limits application to the staff member's library and should be left at the default. Evergreen 
blocks attempts to set Federation- or Sitka-wide privileges.
* *Grantable*: If checked this staff account will be able to grant the new privilege to other accounts 
(not recommended).
=====

Searching for Library Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Library staff accounts can be retrieved via Patron Search and Check Out the same as a patron account.

You can easily retrieve a list of all library staff accounts at your library through the Patron Search.

. Set *Profile Group* to the Library Staff group applicable to your library type.
. Set the organizational unit to your library or system.
. Click *Search*.
+
image::images/admin/staff-account-4.png[]

Support recommends reviewing your staff accounts on a regular basis and closing accounts for 
staff who no longer work at your library.


Closing Library Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

link:https://youtu.be/d-EbdpforW8[*Sitka Training Video - Closing Library Staff Accounts (1:56)*]

When a staff member leaves the library their staff access should be disabled in a timely manner.

A local system administrator at your library needs to do the following:

* remove the working location(s) from the account.
* change the main permission group to a patron permission group.
** contact Support to have the permission group changed for local system administrator accounts.
* contact Support if the staff member had access to view report output or use the reporter.

If the former staff member will not be using the account as a personal borrowing account a local system
administrator can use the http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_deleting_patron_accounts.html[patron deletion tool] to delete the account.

Additionally, if the staff member had access to any other library accounts, such as generic accounts,
those staff accounts must have their xref:_resetting_staff_account_password[passwords updated].

Recurring Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the account being closed is currently used to run recurring reports for the library you have 
two options for handling those reports:

. If the account has only ever been used for staff access (no personal borrowing) you can update the name
 and details on the account (or contact Support in the case of a LSA).  The new user MUST complete a 
 https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[reporter privacy waiver] to comply 
 with Sitka’s privacy policy.
*OR*
. If the account has been used as both a staff and personal borrowing account the reports will need 
to be moved to a new staff member.

Moving Reports to a New Staff Member
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

. Ensure that folder(s) the report templates currently reside in are shared with your library. Sharing them 
makes them visible to anyone at your library who has signed the Full Reporter Privacy Waiver and so has 
access to the Reporter. 
. The new staff member handling reports logs in and clones all the needed report templates into their own 
folders, same as you would clone a report from the Sitka Templates folder.
. Any recurring reports running from the old account need to be cancelled by going into the Reports folder 
for each report and deleting the report. 

[CAUTION]
=========
Deleting reports also deletes any output attached to the report so make sure to download any needed 
report output as Excel or CSV files and save them to your computer or network drive.
