Staff Accounts
--------------

Staff accounts are special patron accounts on Evergreen which have been granted more permissions to allow the owners to log into the Staff Client. They also work to log into your OPAC, same as a patron record.  Besides extra permissions, each staff account has its own working location. Many functions on the staff client are available to the account at the assigned working locations only.

There are three ways staff accounts can be set up and used in the system.

*Staff and Patron Accounts*

Accounts are created for staff members and given the appropriate Library Staff permission group and working location. Staff use the account for borrowing as well as to login into the staff client and perform their work.

*Staff Specific Accounts*

Accounts are created for staff members and given the appropriate Library Staff permission group and working location. These accounts often have something like LOGIN or STAFF as part of the name and may use a barcode such as SITKASTAFF rather than an actual barcode. Staff use the accounts only for logging into the staff client for work. Staff have a separate patron account for borrowing.

*Generic Accounts*

Accounts are created for functions, such as circulation, rather than for specific staff members and given the appropriate Library Staff permission group and working location. These accounts' barcodes and names are often related to their function. For example, an account for circulation may use circulation1 as the barcode and be named Dummy, Circulation. These accounts are shared by the appropriate staff. Sitka Staff strongly encourage libraries to ensure that shared usernames and passwords are kept secure and are changed as needed, especially when staff leave the library.

Co-op Support encourages libraries to use the method or methods that work best for them.

CAUTION: Generic accounts will not be granted permissions to create/run reports. Libraries are encouraged to have a dedicated account(s) for reporting purpose. The account must belong to an individual staff member and is for office use only. To avoid re-setting up reports, the owner of the account may be updated when the reporting task is passed on to another staff member.

Creating Staff Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local System Administrators can create staff accounts the same way as creating a patron record. The difference is choosing a staff profile from the *Main Permission (Profile) Group* list.

After saving the account, retrieve it, go to *Other -> User Permission Editor* to assign the new account a working location. Select the checkbox in front of the libraries that you want to assign to the account. Once done, scroll down to the bottom to click *Save*.

CAUTION: Staff accounts without a working location can not register/edit patron accounts, or access some cataloguing functions.


Creating Local System Administrator Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Local System Administrator profile can only be assigned by Co-op staff.  Libraries may create a staff account first, submit a request to Co-op Support to upgrade the account to local system administrator. Please include the account's barcode in the request.

Editing Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staff members can update their own username, password, and email addresses by logging into *My Account* on your OPAC. They can use the *Forgot your Password* link on the *My Account* login screen as well, as long as their staff account contains a valid email address. Updating your staff account on the OPAC is the same as updating it in the staff client.

Local System Administrators can edit all staff accounts with permissions below LSA.  For edits to Local System Administrator accounts, other than user name, password, or email address, you need to submit a request to Co-op Support.


Resetting Staff Account Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staff passwords can be reset as follows:

. Use the *Forgot Your Password?* link in the *My Account* login screen on your OPAC. You must have an email address recorded in your staff account for this to method to work.

. Have a staff member with higher permissions than you, such as Local System Administrator, assign a new password to your account in staff client.

. Send in a request to Co-op Support to have a temporary password assigned, and then use the *My Account* login on your OPAC to reset it to a secure password. Updating your staff account on the OPAC is the same as updating it in the staff client.


Staff Account Permission Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a general outline of staff account permission levels.  To view a detailed list of permissions for a 
particular Evergreen account, go to *Administration -> User Permission Editor* in the staff client.

NOTE: Only users with reporting permissions (granted by Sitka Support on libraries' request) 
can access the Reports interface or view report output. Any staff requesting reporting 
permissions must sign and submit a Reporter Privacy Waiver
 see https://bc.libraries.coop/support/sitka/reporter-privacy-waiver/[Reporter Privacy Waiver].

Granting Additional Permissions to Staff Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Local System Administrator (LSA) may selectively grant its permissions to other staff accounts. In the example below a Circ +Full Cat account is granted permission to process offline transactions, a function which otherwise requires an LSA login.

. Log in to Evergreen with a local system administrator account.
. Find the staff acount on *User Permission Editor*. You may search for the patron account, then go to *Others -> User Permission Editor*, or go to *Administration -> User Permission Editor* to search for the account by barcode.
. When User Permission Editor is loaded, scroll down the permission list to find *OFFLINE_EXECUTE*. Select the checkbox in *Applied* column. Scroll down to the bottom to click *Save*.

[TIP]
=====
* *Permission*: List of permission names. For help correlating permissions to specific Evergreen functions please contact Co-op support.
* *Applied*: If checked the permission is granted to this account.
* *Depth*:  limits application to the staff member's library and should be left at the default. Evergreen blocks attempts to set Federation- or Sitka-wide privileges.
* *Grantable*: If checked this staff account will be able to grant the new privilege to other accounts (not recommended).
