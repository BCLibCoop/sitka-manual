Sitka's Patron Deletion Tool
----------------------------

The Patron Deletion Tool developed by the Sitka team allows local system administrators to delete 
inactive cards and patron accounts while retaining statistics. 

Staff can only delete cards and accounts for patrons whose home library is their library 
or one of their branches. In some cases staff may need to update a patron's home library
in order for an account to be deleted.

| Scenario	| Action
| An active patron lost their library card and was 
issued a new one using the xref:_barcodes[Replace Barcode] function. |  xref:_deleting_inactive_cards[Delete the 
barcode for lost card]. 
| A patron is no longer active and their account should be 
removed completely.	| xref:_deleting_patron_accounts[Delete the patron account].
| An active patron has more than one account.	| xref:_merging_patron_accounts[Merge the accounts]. Choose the card number that you 
want to keep as the lead record.
|====

[CAUTION]
=========
Evergreen checks against all patrons (un-deleted and deleted) to determine whether a 
username is available to be used.

If the patron has not changed the username it will match their barcode.

If there is any possibility that the username or barcode will be needed in the future staff 
should prefix the username on the current account with DELETED before deleting the account.
=========

Accessing the Patron Deletion Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The patron deletion tool can be accessed from the staff client home page.

Deleting Inactive Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Delete Inactive Cards)))

When the barcode for a patron's account is replaced and a new barcode is assigned, the old barcode remains in the Evergreen 
database as an inactive card. Patrons cannot log into the public catalogue with an inactive barcode, but it can be used 
to authenticate with some 3rd party products and to retrieve the active patron record in the staff client.

Co-op Support strongly recommends libraries delete inactive barcodes on a regular basis. The Sitka_template "NAME GOES HERE"
can be used to generate a list of inactive barcodes at your library which can then be copy/pasted into the Patron Deletion Tool.

. In the xref:_accessing_the_patron_deletion_tool[Patron Deletion Tool] enter the barcodes for the cards to 
be deleted (one barcode per line).
. Check the box for *Delete cards only*.
+

+
. The confirmation page will appear.  Confirm which cards you'd like to delete and click 
*Delete Checked Cards*.

[NOTE]
======
Deleted patron accounts remain in the Evergreen database for reporting purposes but are no longer accessible 
from the staff client.

Undeleting Patron Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron accounts CANNOT be undeleted through the Evergreen staff client.  Library staff
should always double check to ensure they are deleting the correct accounts.

Please contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if an account has been 
accidentally deleted.  You must include the account username in your ticket.
