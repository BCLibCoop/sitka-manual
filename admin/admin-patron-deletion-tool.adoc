Sitka's Patron Deletion Tool
----------------------------

The patron deletion tool developed by the Sitka team allows local system administrators to delete 
inactive cards and patron accounts while retaining needed statistics. This is done outside of patron accounts, 
and a small batch of barcodes/accounts can be deleted at once. The table below describes a few scenarios 
where this tool may be used.

Staff can only delete cards and accounts for patrons whose home library is their library or one of their branches. The home library may need to be updated.

Deleting Inactive Cards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(((Delete Inactive Cards)))

When a patron's card is marked lost and a new barcode is assigned, the old barcode remains in the Evergreen 
database as an inactive card. Deleting lost or inactive cards is optional, but recommended. Patrons 
cannot check out items or log into the OPAC with an inactive card, but the lost cards can be used 
to retrieve the active patron record in the staff client. Whether a library routinely deletes inactive 
cards is a matter of local policy.

. In the Patron Deletion Tool enter the barcodes for the cards to be deleted (one barcode per line).
. Check the box for *Delete cards only*.

[NOTE]
======
Deleted patron accounts remain in the Evergreen database for reporting purposes but are no longer accessible 
from the staff client. The deletion tool checks the following before deleting any account:

*Open circulations*.  Accounts with items checked out cannot be deleted

*Active holds*.  Accounts with active holds cannot be deleted

*Bills*.  Accounts with unpaid bills are flagged but may still be deleted; if deleted the bills are voided
