Sitka's Patron Deletion Tool
----------------------------

The Patron Deletion Tool developed by the Sitka team allows local system administrators to delete 
inactive cards and patron accounts while retaining statistics. 

Staff can only delete cards and accounts for patrons whose home library is their library 
or one of their branches. In some cases staff may need to update a patron's home library
in order for an account to be deleted.

|====
| Scenario	| Action
| An active patron lost a card and was issued a new one (using Replace Barcode)	| Delete the lost card (optional)
| A patron is no longer active and their account should be removed completely	| Delete patron account
| An active patron has more than one account	| Merge the accounts. Choose the card number that you 
want to keep as the lead record. See xref:_merging_patron_accounts[Merging Patron Accounts].
|====

[CAUTION]
=========
Evergreen checks against all patrons (un-deleted and deleted) to determine whether a 
username is available to be used.

If the patron has not changed the username it will match their barcode.

If there is any possibility that the username or barcode will be needed in the future staff 
should prefix the username on the current account with DELETED before deleting the account.

Deleting Inactive Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(((Delete Inactive Cards)))

When a patron's card is marked lost and a new barcode is assigned, the old barcode remains in the Evergreen 
database as an inactive card. Deleting lost or inactive cards is optional, but recommended. Patrons 
cannot check out items or log into the OPAC with an inactive card, but the lost cards can be used 
to retrieve the active patron record in the staff client. Whether a library routinely deletes inactive 
cards is a matter of local policy.

. In the Patron Deletion Tool enter the barcodes for the cards to be deleted (one barcode per line).
. Check the box for *Delete cards only*.

[NOTE]
======
Deleted patron accounts remain in the Evergreen database for reporting purposes but are no longer accessible 
from the staff client.

Undeleting Patron Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patron accounts CANNOT be undeleted through the Evergreen staff client.  Library staff
should always double check to ensure they are deleting the correct accounts.

Please contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if an account has been 
accidentally deleted.  You must include the account username in your ticket.
