Receipt templates use variables for various pieces of information coming from the Evergreen database.  These variables deal with everything from the Library name to the due date of an item. Information from the database is entered in the templates with {{term}}.

To print just a sub-string of a variable, you can use a *limitTo* function.  {{variable | limitTo:limit:begin}} where limit is the number of characters you are wanting, and begin is where you want to start printing those characters. The begin number is not mandatory. To limit the variable to the first four characters, you can use{{variable | limitTo:4}} would get you "vari". To limit to the last five characters you can use {{variable | limitTo:-5}} will get you "iable". {{variable | limitTo:3:3}} will get "ria"
