Patron Notifications
--------------------

Libraries can opt in to a number of automated patron notifications.  These notifications are set up by 
Co-op Support.  If you are unsure what notifications your library has set up, please contact 
xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].

Notifications are sent in three ways, depending on the notification:

* Email - sent directly to the patron
* SMS Text Message - sent directly to the patron
* Mail - sent to the library as a PDF to be printed and mailed out 

Email Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When sending out emails the BC Libraries Cooperative needs to follow all of the best practices and conventions
in order to avoid our emails being marked as spam and to have the best chance of the emails being delivered
successfully to your patrons.  One of the important things we do is ensure that any emails sent 
from our servers have a _From_ address with a domain that can be verified as coming from our servers.  This 
means that all emails sent by Evergreen will come from noreply-YOURLIBRARYCODE@catalogue.libraries.coop. How
this displays to your patrons will depend on their email client.

To discourage patrons from responding to these automated
notifications most of them start with _This is an automated message.  Please do not reply to this email._

In the email notification templates the _Reply to_ address is set to use the email address set for your library
in the library setting _Sending email address for patron notices_.  This ensures that if patrons do reply those
replies are directed to the email of your choice. Bounced emails are also directed to this email address and we 
encourage staff to xref:_invalidating_an_email_address[invalidate any email addresses] that bounce
to help keep us from being blacklisted by email providers.  

Email notifications from Sitka's Evergreen are not spam and should not be marked as spam by either patrons 
or staff.  If patrons do not wish to receive them they can opt out of receiving overdue and courtesy notice 
emails through the xref:_notification_preferences[Notification Preferences] in _My Account_.

Checking for Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((Patron Notifications, Action Triggers)))
(((Triggered Events)))

Evergreen keeps a record, called a triggered event, of courtesy, overdue, and hold notifications sent 
out via email and SMS text message.  You can check to see whether or not a notification was generated.

These records are kept for 3 to 6 months, depending on the type of notification.

. To view notifications in the patron account, select *Other â†’ Triggered Events/Notifications*.

[NOTE]
======
Triggered events with status of Invalid or Error encountered a problem during the generation process.
In these cases no notices were generated.

Statuses such as Pending may last for a short period of time while the event is being processed.
======

Courtesy Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Courtesy notifications are generated and sent via email and/or SMS text message ahead of an item being due.  
If a library has both email and SMS text message courtesy notifications enabled patrons will received both.

[CAUTION]
=========
If the due date is extended via *Edit Due Date* after the courtesy notification is sent out, no 
additional courtesy notification will be generated. Staff are encouraged to use the *Renew* or 
*Renew with Specific Due Date* functions instead to ensure additional notifications are generated in 
due course.
=========


Email Courtesy Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Courtesy notices are generated and sent via email to patrons before an item is due. The standard interval
is 3 days ahead of the due date but this can be customized.  Only patrons with email addresses in their 
patron account will receive email courtesy notifications.

To customize the wording or the interval of the notification please contact 
xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].


SMS Text Message Courtesy Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SMS text message courtesy template is shared by all Sitka libraries and cannot be customized.

Libraries must opt in to have these notifications turned on. Please contact 
xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] to opt in.

Library courtesy notifications are generated and sent via SMS text message to patrons 3 days before 
an item is due. Patrons must have a default Default SMS/Text Number and Default SMS Carrier
 saved in their patron account to receive these notifications. See xref:_patron_account_fields[] for more
 information on these fields.

[CAUTION]
=========
The process that generates courtesy notices runs early in the morning.  SMS text messages are sent around 
*2:00am* PT. 
=========


Overdue Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overdue notifications are available via email and paper.  Library staff can also run reports to generate a 
list of patrons to manually phone.


Email Overdue Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overdue notifications can be sent via email at intervals desired by the library.  The standard intervals
are 7 and 14 days after an item is due but this can be customized. 

To customize the wording or the interval of the notifications please contact 
xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].

Paper Overdue Notices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen can generate a PDF file of overdue notices which is then emailed to the library to be printed and 
distributed to patrons. 

These notices are created and emailed daily.  An email with an empty PDF file means that there are no items 
for that day that meet the criteria to have a paper overdue notice generated. If you do not receive the
daily email with the PDF file please contact xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] as this
means that paper overdues are not generating as expected.

Paper overdues can be generated at the following intervals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 weeks after the 
item becomes due. The intervals define when a second, third, or fourth, and so on, letter is sent out.

Paper overdues at 1 and 2 weeks overdue are generated for only for patrons without email addresses in their 
account. From the 3 weeks onwards the notices are generated for all applicable patrons.

The final paper overdue notice, at the interval of your choosing, can be set up as a billing notice and can
include the item replacement cost and applicable processing fees. The replacement cost comes from the 
_Price_ xref:_item_attributes[item attribute]; if this attribute is blank the value set for the library
setting _Default Item Price_ is used instead.  The processing fee uses the value from the library 
setting _Lost Materials Processing Fee_.

To set up paper overdues for your library, update your existing notices, or update the
email address the PDF file is sent to please contact 
xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].


Overdue Notifications by Phone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some circumstances staff may wish to manually contact patrons with overdue items via the phone.

You can use the report template _Overdues Within Time Span -Phone List for Patrons without Email 
(based on Checkout Library)_ to generate a list of patrons with overdue items in the timeframe you 
specify that do not have an email address on file.

You can also use the report template _Overdues Within Time Span - General (Based on Checkout Library)_
to generate a list of all patrons with overdue items in the timeframe you specify.

Both of these report template can be found under *Shared Folders -> Sitka_templates -> Circulation -> 
Overdue and others*.  These reports can be run as a one off or set up as a 
xref:/_running_recurring_reports[recurring report] which emails
the report to the specified staff email.

Overdue Mark Lost Notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen can automatically mark items as lost that have been overdue for a specfied period of time.  When this
process runs the item is set the status of lost and a lost bill is applied to the patron's account.  
The bill includes the item's replacement cost from the _Price_ xref:_item_attributes[item attribute], 
if this attribute is blank the value set for the library setting _Default Item Price_ is used instead, and
a processing fee from the value in the library setting _Lost Materials Processing Fee_.

When enabled the Overdue Mark Lost notification is sent via email to patrons when Evergreen automatically
 marks an item as lost.  This notification is not sent when staff manually mark an item as lost.
 
If you use paper overdues you may to have this set up so that items are marked lost in tandem with a 
paper overdue billing notice being generated.

To customize the wording of the notification or set up the automatic to lost process please contact 
xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].


Hold Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hold Ready For Pickup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a hold is ready for pickup, the requester can be notified via automatic email and/or SMS Text, and/or manual phone call by staff, depending on the choice made when he/she placed the hold. The selected notification method(s) may be indicated on the hold slip. For example, if email notification is selected, the email address will be printed on the hold slip. A blank email address indicates that email notification was not selected.

For automatic email notice and SMS Text, it works the same way as the automatic overdue notices. The notification email/SMS Text is generated and sent to the patron 5 to 30 minutes after the item achieves on-hold-shelf status. In order to receive these notices the patron must have chosen these notification methods when placing the hold, and the email address and or mobile number/carrier in his/her account must be valid.

The ready-for-pickup hold notification templates can be customized at the federation or library level. Please contact Co-op Support for customization.

For phone notification, staff needs to phone patrons individually. Phone numbers are printed on the hold slips when holds are captured, if phone notification is chosen.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Holds Cancelled by Staff 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This notification is optional for individual libraries. The notification templates can be customized on library level. Please contact Co-op Support if your library wishes to use this service.

An email is sent to the requester when a hold is cancelled by staff on the staff client. The staff note on cancellation will be included in the email explaining the cancellation reason.

Shelf Expired Holds Cancellation Notice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This notification is optional for individual libraries. The notification templates can be customized on library level. Please contact Co-op Support if your library wishes to use this service.

Patron Account Notices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome Email to New Patrons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An email will be sent to new patrons the day after their account is created, welcoming them to the library and confirming that the email address in their account is correct.

Patron Account Expiration Email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An email will be sent to patrons 30 days before their account is set to expire. This is intended to give users time to renew their account before they lose access to library services.

These emails are not spam and should not be marked as spam by either patrons or staff.

The two patron account notices are optional, and libraries must opt in. Libraries can choose to opt in to only one or both of these notices. The patron account notice templates can be customized at the federation or library level. Please contact Co-op Support for set up and customization.
