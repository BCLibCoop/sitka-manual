Server Administration
---------------------

Most options under the Server Administration menu are global Sitka settings that cannot be changed locally.
The exception includes the call number prefix/suffix, and the  Organizational Units submenu, which allows
Local System Administrators to edit library contact information, hours of operation, and addresses.

There is some view-only information that is useful under Server Administration, in particular the list
of Item Statuses.

Floating Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen supports floating collections. Floating items stay at the checkin library, instead of being
sent back to the item's original circulating library. Floating Groups are used to limit the range of
libraries that an item can float within. Please contact
 https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] if you wish make all or part of
your items float within selected libraries/branches.

Hard Due Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Academic libraries may wish to use hard due dates to truncate due dates at the end of a semester or 
allow particular material to go out for an entire semester.  

Viewing Your Hard Due Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local system administrators can view hard due dates for your library but cannot update or add
new dates. 

. Go to *Administration -> Server Administration -> Hard Due Date Changes*.
. Existing hard due dates will display for the current working location with the current ceiling 
date visible. Multi-branch libraries should use the library selector to display hard due dates for their 
system and descendants.

. To see past and upcoming dates for a specific hard due date click *Values* on the applicable line.
+

. The dates will display.

Changing Your Hard Due Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to update or add hard due dates please 
contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] 
with the following:

* Date or dates for the hard due date
* Who and what the hard due date should apply to
** Refer to xref:_understanding_your_circulation_policies[Understanding Your Circulation Policies] for the information on the parameters you can specify
* Whether the hard due should apply all the time or just truncate the regular due dates when they would
fall after the hard due date
** Libraries can have both types of hard due dates if you'd like different scenarios to apply to different
patron groups or items.  For example, you may want to have regular loan durations apply to students until
the end of term when they start to truncate while faculty members always get to check out items for the
entire semester.

[TIP]
=====
Send your new hard due dates to Support on a regular basis to ensure your circulation works as expected.

For instance, you may wish to send the dates for your fall, winter, and summer terms to Support every
 August so that your dates can be entered for the entire year.

[TIP]
=====

. If the *Sets copy active* is set to NO, an item created with this status will not have the *Active Date* field filled. The date will be filled later when the item achieves a status with *Sets copy active* is set to YES.

. If Is Available? is set to YES, items with that status will appear in search results when the *Limit to Available* checkbox is checked and can be checked out without needing to be first checked in or have any prompts regarding unavailable status appearing.
