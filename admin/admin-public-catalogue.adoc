Public Catalogue Customizations
-------------------------------

Certain things in your public catalogue can be customized for you by Sitka staff.  Making these changes 
takes time so please ensure you xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[contact Co-op Support] with your 
requested changes at least one week before you want the changes live.

Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^

Each library can customize the Evergreen public catalogue with their logo and colours. 

The logo should be sent to xref:[Co-op Support] as a .png file.

[NOTE]
======
Co-op Support recommends thinking about how your logo will display on different devices.  Large or long
logos may not display well when the public catalogue is viewed on a mobile device.
======

There can be separate colours for:

* the header
* the footer
* the buttons (search, clear form, my account)
* the facets (to the left of the search results)

Please provide the colours you want in their hex codes. If you like a colour used on another Sitka library's
public catalogue let us know and we can pull the hex code from their site.

By default there are two links in the header - _Library Home_ and _My Account_.  Additional links can
be added to point to other resources and pages the library wishes to include.  To have a link added
please send both the link and the text to display to xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support].

By default the public catalogue displays just the date for due dates.  Libraries that have hourly loans
can choose to have the due date time included; the due date time will display for all check outs, not
just hourly loans.

A temporary banner with text and links can be applied across the top of your public catalogue.  The yearly 
banner for Sitka's Evergreen upgrade will override local banners.

Search Library Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing agreements that allow patrons to place holds, 
like Interlibrary Connect, have three option for how their public catalogue scopes.

. Only your library displays in the search library list
. All libraries in your zone display in the search list and your library is the default
. All libraries in your zone display in the search list and the top organization in the zone is the default

My Account Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The text on the My Account login page can be customized if your library has specific information that patrons
need for logging in that isn't covered by the default text.

. Username Label
.. This text can be customized.
. Username Hint
.. This text can be customized.
. Password Label
.. This text can be customized.
. Password Hint
.. This text can be controlled by the library setting _uses phone as default pin_ which switches the text between 
wording about a default PIN or using the last 4 digits of the patron's phone number.  
.. This text can also be customized if neither option covers the information your patrons need.


Patron Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ability for a patron to change their email can be disabled for libraries that require patrons 
to use an institution issued email address.

The ability for a patron to change their password can be disabled for libraries that use single-sign on or
similar products.

The ability for a patron to select hold notification by phone can be disabled for libraries that never contact
patrons by phone.

The password strength message can be customized if your library requires different criteria than Evergreen's
default.
