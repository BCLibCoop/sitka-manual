Administration Overview
------------------------

Adminstration functions are available on the *Administration* dropdown menu.  Functions on this menu are grouped into either the target module that the configuration applied to or the effective scope, e.g. individual workstations, libraries or the whole consortium.  These function are visible to anyone logged into the staff client,  but most of them usually require special permissions to edit. 


*Workstation Administration*: Here you may register your computer with extra libraries, configure printer settings, printer templates, workstation's settings and their storage.

*Local Adminstration*: Most settings applied to indiviudal libraries are configured here. 

*Server Administration*: Settings here are mainly applied to the whole consortium. But individual libraries can configure a few items, such as, call number prefix/suffix, library's operation hours and addresses under Orginaztion Unit.
