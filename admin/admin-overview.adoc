Administration Overview
------------------------

Adminstration functions are available on the *Administration* dropdown menu.  Functions on this menu are grouped into either the target module that the configuration applied to or the effective scope, e.g. individual workstations, libraries or the whole consortium.  These function are visible to anyone logged into the staff client,  but most of them usually require special permissions to edit.
