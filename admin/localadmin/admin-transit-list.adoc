Transit List

anchor:transit-list[Transit List]

The transit list tracks items that are in transit between libraries. Libraries should check this list on
a regular basis for items that have been in transit longer than normal.

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Transit List*. 
. Select *Transit To* or *Transit From*. 
. Specify a date range.
. Multi-branch libraries must select a specific branch to see the items in transit to or from that branch. 
. Items were sent in transit during the date range and are still in transit are listed.

. Libraries should search for items that have been in transit longer than normal.  

TIP: If hold information, e.g. Hold ID in the above screenshot, is displayed, 
it means the item is in transit to fill a hold.
