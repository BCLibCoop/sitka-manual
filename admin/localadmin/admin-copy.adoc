NOTE: Text in the Label prefix and Label suffix fields will automatically be added to spine labels printed for items in the selected copy location. It does not affect OPAC or staff client display.
 
TIP: Whether an item can be circulated, holdable or visible on OPAC is controlled by three factors: item status, shelving location and item attributes (the options in the Copy Editor). Evergreen follows the aforementioned sequence to check the value of each factor until it encounters a NO. An item can be circulated, holdable or visible on OPAC when all three factors are set to YES.
