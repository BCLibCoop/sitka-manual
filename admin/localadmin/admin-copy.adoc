+* *Holdable* means a patron is able to place a hold on an item in this location.
+* *Hold Verify*, if set up, will generate a prompt when an item is captured for a hold.

Click *Translate* to enter optional translations of copy location titles for OPAC display when patrons select other languages.

Text in the Label prefix and Label suffix fields will automatically be added to spine labels printed for items in the selected copy location. It does not affect OPAC or staff client display.
 
TIP: Whether an item can be circulated, holdable or visible on OPAC is controlled by three factors: item status, shelving location and item attributes (the options in the Copy Editor). Evergreen follows the aforementioned sequence to check the value of each factor until it encounters a NO. An item can be circulated, holdable or visible on OPAC when all three factors are set to YES.

NOTE: After creating or deleting a copy location, log out of the staff client and clear the cache to ensure changes are reflected in the copy editor. This is not required for edits to existing copy locations.
