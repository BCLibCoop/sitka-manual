Hold policies defines who can place how many holds on what types of materials. They also defines whether 
the library's materials can be used to fill holds to be picked up at other libraries.

When a hold is initiated Evergreen checks the following to determine if the hold can be placed and if it
will be filled:

* Item's xref:_item_statuses[Status]
* Holdable flag for the item's xref:_shelving_location_editor[Shelving Location]
* xref:_item_attributes[Holdable flag for the item]
* xref:_age_based_hold_protection[Age based hold protection for the item]
* Hold Policies
** xref:_age_based_hold_protection[Age based hold protection] within the hold policies.


Viewing Your Hold Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view your current hold policies run a report (reporter permissions required) or
view your policies in Evergreen (Local System Administrator permissions required).

* In the reporter go to *Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Library Configuration*
+
** Multiple report templates for hold policies are available here.
+
* In Evergreen select *Administration -> Local Administration -> Hold Policies*.

[NOTE]
====
For libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing like Interlibrary Connect not all hold policies will
display in Evergreen by default.  To ensure you see all your policies you need to filter the display twice: once
by Owning Library, and then a second time by Pickup Library.

Click *Filter* under *Pickup Library*. In the popped up window, select *Is (or includes)*, check the box for *+ Ancestors*, and choose your library. Click
*Apply filter* to display policies based on the pickup library.

Click *Filter* under *Owning Library*. In the popped up window, select *Is (or includes)*, check the box for *+ Ancestors*, and choose your library. Click
*Apply filter* to display policies based on the owning library.

Changing Your Hold Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All changes to your hold policies are made by Co-op Support Staff.

Submit a ticket to https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] to request changes to your circulation policies.
We recommend submitting your request at least one week before you'd like the change to go into effect.

In your request please include the specific changes you need made.  

When requesting a new hold policy you must include:

* Circulation modifier or item age
* What patron group(s) the policy applies to
* The maximum number of holds (if applicable)
* Whether or not interlibrary connect holds can be placed (for libraries participating in 
reciprocal borrowing)
