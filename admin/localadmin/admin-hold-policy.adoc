Hold Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

anchor:hold-policy[Hold Policy]

The Hold Policy for each library or library system defines who can place how many holds on what types 
of materials. It also defines whether the library's materials can be used to fill holds picked up at other 
libraries. Hold policies are usually defined by a combination of the Requestor Permission Group 
(eg. Public Library Users, Public Library Staff etc.), item attributes like circulation modifier (
eg. book, juvenile-collection etc.), and library (user home, item's owning and circulating library) 
with additional parameters of maximum holds and whether a hold can be placed at all. Transit Range 
defines where the library's materials can go to fill holds.

[NOTE]

To view your current hold policies run a report (reporter permissions required) or
view your policies in Evergreen (Local System Administrator permissions required).

* In the reporter go to *Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Library Configuration*

** Multiple report templates for hold policies are available here.

* In Evergreen select *Administration -> Local Administration -> Hold Policies*. Select your 
library from the drop down list in *Context Org Unit*. 

The first screen provides a summary view of each hold rule for your library, and more detail can be seen by 
clicking on the individual entries.

[NOTE]
====
For libraries participating in reciprocal borrowing like Interlibrary Connect not all hold policies will
display in Evergreen by default.  To ensure you see all your policies you need to filter the display twice.  Once by Owning Library 
and then a second time by Pickup Library.  Click *Filter* under 
Context Org Unit. In the popped up window, select *Owning Library* or *Pickup Library* from the first dropdown list; *Is* from the second 
list, and your library or library system the third. Click *Apply* to limit display to rules applied based on 
the owning library or pickup library.
====

Select the individual hold policy for viewing by double-clicking on the desired row.  
In the below example, all Sitka public library patrons, including all profiles under Public Library Patron, 
are able to place holds on BPE library's items of any circulation modifier and pick up these items at BPE library. 
The hold limit is 9999, meaning no limit.
