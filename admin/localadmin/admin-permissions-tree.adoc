Changing Your Permission Tree

Only Co-op Support can edit notifications / action triggers. 

Local system administrators can view notifications / action triggers within Evergreen, but 
making changes and clicking save will have no effect.

Submit a ticket to https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] to request changes to your notifications / action triggers.
We recommend submitting your request at least one week before you'd like the change to go into effect.

In your request please include the specific changes you need made.
