Permission Tree Display Entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The permission tree display entries allow the list of patron (profile) permission groups
to be customized per library. If you do not have a customized tree, Evergreen will use the default tree for your library type.

Viewing Your Permission Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local system administrators can view the custom permission tree for your library but 
cannot make changes.

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Permissions Tree Display Entries*.
. The permission group tree for your library will display. Multi-branch libraries will need to change the library selector to your
system.

. If you don't have a custom permission group tree, nothing will show under display entries.

. Once set up the custom permission tree will display in the _Main (Profile) Permission Group_ drop down in the patron registration
and patron edit interfaces. The full list continues to display in the patron search interface.

Changing Your Permission Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Co-op Support can edit permission trees.

Submit a ticket to https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] to request changes to permission tree or to ask for 
one to be set up.

In your request please include the which permission groups you would like added and the order you would like them to be in.
