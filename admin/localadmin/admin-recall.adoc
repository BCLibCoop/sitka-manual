Hold-driven Recall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Academic libraries usually allow extended loan periods to some patron types on some materials. They will recall these items when other patrons request them. Hold-driven Recall automates this process.

When libraries recall an item they ususally shorten the loan period and block renewal. They may also change the fine rate and maximum fine amount. A notice (via email) is sent to the current borrower to inform him/her of the change.

Evergreen uses three library setting entries to trigger hold-driven recall and define change parameters. When a hold is placed and there is no availabe copy, Evergeen will check whether the Recall settings are set up for the library. If settings are on and recall condition is met, a recall will be triggered.

Go to Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor to set them up.

. Recalls: Circulation duration that triggers a recall
+
This is the threshold that decides whether a recall is triggered. Recalls are triggered only when items are checked out with a loan period longer than the one specified in this entry. For example, in a library the longest general loan period is 35 days. Extended loan to faculty is 92 days. You may specify, e.g. 36 days or 90 days in this entry to trigger recalls on items checked out to faculty with extended loan period. But you need to consider the next entry to make your decision.
+
TIP: Evergreen uses the loan duration rule in circulation records as the loan period of a circulation. It does not calculate the loan period from the checkout and due dates. If you set specific due date on checkout, the actual loan period and the loan duration rule may not match.

. Recalls: Truncated loan period
+
When a recall is triggered, Evergreen will reset the due date in the current circulation record. The new due date is calculated based on the value entered in this entry and the above. The later date generated by these two entries will be the new due date. For example, the truncated loan period is 7 days and the threshold in the above entry is 36 days. On 2013-07-01 a recall is triggered on an item checked out on 2013-06-09, and the new due date based on truncated loan period will be 2013-07-08 (2013-07-01 + 7 days), while 2013-07-15 is based on the recall threshold (2013-06-09 + 36 days). Evergreen will set the new due date to 2013-07-15. If the above item is recalled on 2013-07-10, the due date from the truncated loan period will be 2013-07-17. This will be the new due date. In other words, the recall threshold is the minimum loan period an extended loan can be shortened to, and patrons with extended loan items will have at least the truncated loan period when they receive the recall notice.
+
CAUTION: Under extreme circumstance, overdue items' loan periods may be extended, e.g. an extended loan checked out in last term is recalled in this term. 

. Recalls: An array of fine amount, fine interval, and maximum fine.
+
This is optional. If you wish to set up new fine rules on recalled items, follow the example quoted in the Library Settings Editor. Make sure the brackets and double quotation around the fine interval are included.
