Action Triggers/Notifications(6:44)*]

.Action Triggers are used for:
* Patron Email and SMS Notifications
* Some Print functions
* Automatically setting overdue items to Lost

Some templates are set at the Sitka level and cannot be customized. Most templates are 
customizable per library.

See xref:_patron_notifications[] for details on what notices can be set up for your library.

Changing Your Notifications / Action Triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Co-op Support can edit notifications / action triggers. 

Local system administrators can view notifications / action triggers within Evergreen, but 
making changes and clicking save will have no effect.

Submit a ticket to https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] to request changes to your notifications / action triggers.
We recommend submitting your request at least one week before you'd like the change to go into effect.

In your request please include the specific changes you need made.

When requesting a change to a notification / action trigger you must include:

* The name of the notification / action trigger.
** This is found in the _Name_ column.
* The specific wording you would like changed.
** The most efficient way to provide this is to copy the relevant template
into your support request, make your desired changes, and then submit the request to Co-op Support.
* If applicable, your desired processing delay.
** For example, _Hold Ready for Pick Up_ email notifications have a default processing delay of 30 minutes which 
can be customized per library.
