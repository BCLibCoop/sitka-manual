[NOTE]
====
All changes to your circulation policies are made by Support.  

To request a changes to your circulation policies submit a ticket to https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Support]. 
We recommend submitting your request at least one week before you'd like the change go into affect.
====

To view your current circulation policies run a report (reporter permissions required) or
view your policies in Evergreen (Local System Administrator permissions required).

* In the reporter go to *Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Library Configuration*

** Multiple report templates for circulation policies are available here.

* In Evergreen select *Administration ->  Local Administration -> Circulation Policies*. By default, your library is selected 
in the box after *Context Org Unit* (i.e. Checkout Library). The initial display will show all circulation rules 
at your library and the federation level. 

** You can filter the display to show rules applied to selected materials, e.g. DVDs. Click *Filter* under 
Context Org Unit. In the popped up window, select *Org Unit* from the first dropdown list; *Is* from the second 
list, and your library or library system the third. Click *Add Row* to add a filter on circulation modifier. 
Click *Apply* to limit display to rules applied to the selected circulation modifier checked out at your library.

** The resulting screen provides a summary view of each circulation rule for your library, and more detail can be 
seen by clicking on the individual entries.

** Select the individual circulation policy for viewing by double-clicking on the desired row.

The circulation rules are typically attached to the Org Unit (checkout library), User Permission Group, 
Copy Circ Library, and Circulation Modifier of the items being circulated. For example, the rule below is for 
items with circulating library of any BC_ILC library and circulation modifier of 'bookclub' to be checked out to 
all Public Library Patrons at BFSJ.
+
Each circulation rule defines the Loan Duration, Renewal, Recurring Fine, Maximum Fine, Grace Period, and whether 
the item is allowed to circulate at all. For example, circulation items falling under the rule below would have a 
loan duration rule of "7_28_42_0", a recurring fine rule of "twentycents" per day and a maximum fine amount of 
"tendollar".
+
A rule is turned off, if the *Active* box is unchecked.

**Clicking *Save* will have no affect as only Support can make changes to circulation policies.

[TIP]
====
* Circulation policies define the loan duration, renewals, recurring fine rate, maximum fine amount, grace period 
and item specific limits rules for different combinations of User Permission Groups, Home Library and Circulation Modifiers 
for items checked out at your library or library system. Other item attributes may be used for more specific rules. 

* There may be more than one policies applicable to certain types of materials. Generally, policies on more 
specific levels, e.g. BFSJ instead of BC_ILC, take precedence. When in doubt, please contact Co-op support.
