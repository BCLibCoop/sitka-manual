Circulation Policies

anchor:circulation-policy[Circulation Policy]


Circulation policies tell Evergreen what to do when an item is scanned for check out.  This can vary from 
check out to check out based on factors including the item's circulation modifier, shelving location, and 
the patron's permission profile.

When an item is scanned for check out Evergreen checks the following to determine if the item can be checked 
out to the patron and if so with what parameters:

* Group Penalty Thresholds for the check out library
* Item's Status
* Circulate flag for the item's Shelving Location
* Circulate flag for the item
* Circulation Policies for the check out library
* Library Operating Hours for the check out library
* Closed Dates Editor for the check out library


Viewing Your Circulation Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To easiest way to view your current circulation policies is to run a report (reporter permissions required).

* In the reporter go to *Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Library Configuration*

** Libraries participating in any reciprocal borrowing agreements should use the template 
_Circulation Policies by Checkout Library_.
** All other libraries should use the template _Circulation Policies filtering by copy circ lib_.

Local system administrators can also view their policies within Evergreen by going to 
*Administration ->  Local Administration -> Circulation Policies*.

Only 15 policies display per page so if you want to see all your policies at once running a report is the 
better option.

By default, your library is selected in the box after *Context Org Unit* (i.e. Checkout Library). 
The initial display will show circulation policies at both your library and the federation level. 

Understanding Your Circulation Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Circulation policies can be divided into two parts - the pieces that determine which patrons and items a policy
applies to and the pieces that determine how the policy is applied.

Who/What Does A Policy Apply To

*Patron Permission Profile*



* Org Unit (Owning Library)
* Circulating Library
* User Home Library
* Circulation Modifier
* Shelving Location
* Reference
* Item Age


How Is the Policy Applied

* Circulate? - true/false
* Duration Rule - includes renewals
* Hard Due Date
* Recurring Fine Rule
* Maximum Fine Rule
* Grace Period
* Item Specific Limit


Troubleshooting Your Circulation Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an item doesn't check out as expected it is usually because there is an issue with the item
or the library's circulation policies need to be updated.  

If multiple items aren't following the expected policy check your circulation policies to make sure the 
expected policy is included in your policies.

If a particular item isn't checking out as expected: 

. Enter the item barcode into _Item Status_ and click on *Detail View*.
+
.. Here you can see information about the item as well as the circulation policy applied.  
+

+
. Check the values for Circulate, Circ Library, Owning Library, Shelving Location, Loan Duration, Fine Level, 
Reference, and Circ Modifier.
.. The most common reason an item doesn't follow the expected policy is because it has the wrong 
circulation modifier applied or doesn't have a circulation modifier at all.
. If any values are incorrect edit the item to have the correct values.
. To apply the correct policy you need to check the item in and then back out to the patron.
. If the item still doesn't follow the expected policy double check the patron's permission profile 
matches what is specified in the policy you expect to be followed.
. If the item still doesn't follow the expected policy contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Support] 
for assistance.
.. In your ticket make sure to include the item barcode, the patron barcode, and a description of what 
is currently happening and what should be happening.


If you're unsure about what values are used for different policies you can run the circulation policy report
to view your current circulation policies. 


Changing Your Circulation Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anytime you change your library's policies circulation make sure you 

All changes to your circulation policies are made by Support.  

To request changes to your circulation policies submit a ticket to https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Support]. 
We recommend submitting your request at least one week before you'd like the change go into effect.

Changes made to circulation policies only apply to new circulations.  Items already checked out will
continue to follow the policy that was in place at the time of check out.

With reciprocal borrowing circulation policies often involve multiple organizational units.  Due to this only
Support can make changes to circulation policies.



Original Docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Circulation policies define the loan duration, renewals, recurring fine rate, maximum fine amount, grace period 
and item specific limits for different combinations of User Permission Groups, Home Library and Circulation Modifiers 
for items checked out at your library or library system. Other item attributes may be used for more specific rules. 

There may be more than one policy applicable to certain types of materials. Generally, policies on more 
specific levels, e.g. BFSJ instead of BC_ILC, take precedence. When in doubt, please contact Co-op support.

To view your current circulation policies run a report (reporter permissions required) or
view your policies in Evergreen (Local System Administrator permissions required).

* In the reporter go to *Shared Folders -> Templates -> Sitka_templates -> Library Configuration*

** Multiple report templates for circulation policies are available here.

* In Evergreen select *Administration ->  Local Administration -> Circulation Policies*. By default, your library is selected 
in the box after *Context Org Unit* (i.e. Checkout Library). The initial display will show all circulation rules 
at your library and the federation level. 

** You can filter the display to show policies applied to selected materials, e.g. DVDs. Click *Filter* under 
Context Org Unit. In the popped up window, select *Org Unit* from the first drop down menu; *Is* from the second, 
and your library or library system from the third. Click *Add Row* to add a filter on circulation modifier. 
Click *Apply* to limit display to policies applied to the selected circulation modifier checked out at your library.

** The resulting screen provides a summary view of each circulation policy for your library, and more detail can be 
seen by clicking on the individual entries.

** Select the individual circulation policy for viewing by double-clicking on the desired row.
+
The circulation policies are typically attached to the Org Unit (checkout library), User Permission Group, 
Copy Circ Library, and Circulation Modifier of the items being circulated. For example, the policy below is for 
items with circulating library of any BC_ILC library and circulation modifier of 'bookclub' to be checked out to 
all Public Library Patrons at BFSJ.
+
Each circulation policy defines the Loan Duration, Renewal, Recurring Fine, Maximum Fine, Grace Period, and whether 
the item is allowed to circulate at all. For example, circulation items falling under the policy below would have a 
loan duration rule of "7_28_42_0", a recurring fine rule of "twentycents" per day and a maximum fine amount of 
"tendollar".
+
A policy is turned off if the *Active* box is unchecked.

** Clicking *Save* will have no effect as only Support can make changes to circulation policies.
