Circulation Policy

anchor:circulation-policy[Circulation Policy]

A user with LSA privileges can view your library's circulation policies. Changes to circulation policies can be requested through the Sitka support team.

* Select *Administration ->  Local Administration -> Circulation Policies*. By default, your library is selected in the box after *Context Org Unit* (i.e. Checkout Library). The initial display will show all circulation rules at your library and the federation level. 

* You can filter the display to show rules applied to selected materials, e.g. DVDs. Click *Filter* under Context Org Unit. In the popped up window, select *Org Unit* from the first dropdown list; *Is* from the second list, and your library or library system the third. Click *Add Row* to add a filter on circ-modifier. Click *Apply* to limit display to rules applied to the selected circ_modifier checked out at your library.

* The resulting screen provides a summary view of each circulation rule for your library, and more detail can be seen by clicking on the individual entries.

* Select the individual circulation policy for viewing by double-clicking on the desired row.

The circulation rules are typically attached to the Org Unit (checkout library), User Permission Group, and Copy Circ Library and Circulation Modifier of the items being circulated. For example, the rule below is for items with circulating library of any BC_LIC library and circulation modifier of 'bookclub' to be checked out to all Public Library Patrons at BFSJ.
+
Each circulation rule defines the Loan Duration, Renewal, Recurring Fine, Maximum Fine, Grace Period and whether the item is allowed to circulate at all. For example, circulation items falling under the rule below would have a loan duration rule of "7_28_42_0", a recurring fine rule of "twentycents" per day and a maximum fine amount of "tendollar".

A rule is turned off, if the *Active* box is unchecked.

[TIP]
====
* Circulation policies define the loan duration, renewals, recurring fine rate, maximum fine amount, grace period and maximum items out rules for different combinations of User Permission Groups and Home Library, and Circ Modifiers for items checked out at your library or library system. Other item attributes may be used for more specific rules. Please contact Co-op support.

* There may be more than one policies applicable certain types of materials. Generally policies on more specific levels, e.g. BFSJ instead of BC_ILC, take procedence. When in doubt, please contact Co-op support.
