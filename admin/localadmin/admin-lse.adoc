Library Settings Editor

(((Library Settings Editor)))

anchor:library-settings-editor[Library Settings Editor]

Local system administrators can use library settings to customize some of
Evergreen's behavior for their library or library system. 

Library setting are set in one of four ways:

* No value by default and library staff can set a value if desired.
* Value is the Sitka default and can be changed by library staff if desired.
* Value is set for all of Sitka by Co-op Support and cannot be changed by library staff.
* Library setting is obsolete or for functionality not used by Sitka.

The tables in xref:_settings_overview[] describe the available settings and indicate who 
can edit each library settings.

All libraries MUST have a value set for the library setting 
_Sending email address for patron notices_.  This ensures that any bounces or responses to
automatic emails such as courtesy, hold, and overdue email notices go to the applicable
library.

Editing Library Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor*.
. There are over 400 library settings so the editor will take a moment to load them.
. Find the setting you wish to edit by browsing the list or filtering using search terms. The
filter searches both the name and description for the settings.
. Enter your search term in the filter box and click *Filter*.
+

. Click the *Edit* button beside the setting you would like to change.
+
image::images/admin/library-settings-2.png[]
+
. In the pop-up that appears read the description to learn about the setting and 
in some cases the options for the setting.
+
[NOTE]
======
Different settings require different data formats for their values.  See xref:_library_setting_data_types[]
for more information.
======
. Make your change and click *Update Setting*.

You can revert back to an old value by clicking *revert*.


Exporting/Importing Library Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
((("Exporting", "Library Settings Editor")))
((("Importing", "Library Settings Editor")))

. To export library settings, click the *Export* button on the above
_Library Setting Editor_ screen. Click *Copy* in the pop-up window.
Those settings displayed on the screen are copied to the clipboard.
Paste the contents to a text editor, such as Notepad. Save the file on
your computer.
. To import library settings, click the *Import* button on the _Library
Settings Editor_ screen. Open your previously saved file and copy the
contents. Click *Paste* in the pop-up window. Click *Submit*.

Settings Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library settings editor groups settings into different categories. In this documentation
the settings have been divided into tables based on the value of their _Group_ column.

Each table describes the available settings in the group and shows which can be changed 
by library staff, what the default value is if applicable, and which settings are
set globally for the consortium by Co-op Support. 

[NOTE]
======
Some library settings apply to old features that have been replaced or features 
that are not currently used by the Sitka consortium.  

These library settings have been marked as not in use by Sitka or as obsolete so library staff
know they can be ignored in the editor.

|Lost check-in generates new overdues|Enabling this setting causes retroactive creation 
of not-yet-existing overdue fines on lost item check-in, up to the point of check-in time

|Disable automatic print attempt type list|Disable automatic print attempts 
from staff client interfaces for the receipt types in this list. Possible values: 
"Checkout", "Bill Pay", "Hold Slip", "Transit Slip", and "Hold/Transit Slip". 
This is different from the Auto-Print checkbox in the pertinent interfaces in that 
it disables automatic print attempts altogether, rather than encouraging silent 
printing by suppressing the print dialogue. The Auto-Print checkbox in these interfaces 
have no effect on the behavior for this setting. In the case of the Hold, Transit,

were not delivered.  Multi-branch libraries must set the email at the branch level 
rather than the system level, though the same email can be used for each branch. |Text| | LSA
