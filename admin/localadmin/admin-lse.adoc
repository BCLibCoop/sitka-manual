anchor:library-settings-editor[Library Settings Editor]

Local system administrators can use library settings to customize some of
Evergreen's behavior for their library or library system. 

Library setting are set in one of four ways:

* No value by default and library staff can set a value if desired.
* Value is the Sitka default and can be changed by library staff if desired.
* Value is set for all of Sitka by Co-op Support and cannot be changed by library staff.
* Library setting is obsolete or for functionality not used by Sitka.

The tables in xref:_settings_overview[] describe the available settings and indicate who 
can edit each library settings.

Settings Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library settings editor groups settings into different categories. In this documentation
the settings have been divided into tables based on the value of their _Group_ column.

Each table describes the available settings in the group and shows which can be changed 
by library staff, what the default value is if applicable, and which settings are
set globally for the consortium by Co-op Support.
