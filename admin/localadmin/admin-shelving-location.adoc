[NOTE]
======
In order for a library's shelving locations to be translated in the public catalogue the library must 
first provide Co-op Support with a list of the library's shelving locations with the translations so the
translations can be entered into Evergreen.

Creating a Shelving Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Click *New Shelving Location*.
. Enter the relevant information for your shelving location and click *Save*.
+
* *Circulate?* means an item in this location can be checked out.
* *Checkin Alert* will prompt staff to route the item to the location when checking in items with this location.
* *Hold Capture Requires Verification*, if set up, will generate a prompt when an item is captured for a hold.
* *Holdable* means a patron is able to place a hold on an item in this location.
* *OPAC Visible* means items in the location will display in your public catalogue.
* *Label Prefix* and *Label Suffix*, if set up, will be automatically included when printing spine labels.

[NOTE]
======
Text in the Label prefix and Label suffix fields will automatically be added to
spine labels printed for items in the selected shelving location. It does not affect
OPAC or staff client display.
======

[TIP]
=====
Whether an item can be circulated, is holdable, or visible on the OPAC, is
controlled by three factors: item status, shelving location, and item attributes
(the options in the Holdings Editor). Evergreen follows the aforementioned sequence 
to check the value of each factor until it encounters a NO. An item can be circulated,
holdable or visible on OPAC when all three factors are set to YES.

[CAUTION]
=========
If your library uses the acquisitions module and loads vendor records make sure you let your vendors
know about any changes you make to shelving location names that are used in their templates.  If the shelving
location name doesn't match between Evergreen and the $l in the templates your MARC records will not load.
=========


Deleting a Shelving Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shelving location containing non-deleted items cannot be deleted in Evergreen.  Co-op Support recommends 
running a report using the Sitka report template 
_Shelving Location : Copies with Selected Shelving Location_ to check for non-deleted item 
before attempting to delete a shelving location.

. Select the shelving location you wish to delete.
. From the *Actions* menu selected *Delete Selected*.
+

+
. The shelving location will still display in the list but _Is Deleted?_ will have a value of _Yes_.

[NOTE]
======
In the Shelving Locations Editor you can use the filter to display only shelving locations where
_Is Deleted?_ is _No_.

Because deleted shelving locations also display in the reporter Co-op Support recommends renaming 
deleted shelving locations to start with Z.  Deleted shelving locations
will then sort alphabetically to the bottom of the list and it is very evident when running reports 
that filter on shelving location which shelving locations in the list are deleted.

https://youtu.be/hjcLkDG2IFM[*Sitka Snippet Video - Shelving Location Order (1:22)*]

Libraries can specify the order shelving locations should appear on the 
xref:_pull_list_for_hold_requests[holds pull list].

Ordering the shelving locations so that locations that are physically close to 
each other appear together on the list can make it easier for staff pulling holds.

. Go to *Administration-> Local Administration-> Shelving Locations Order.*
. Select the shelving location you would like to re-order.
. Use the arrow buttons to move the location up or down the list, or move it to the top or bottom
of the list. 
+

. Once all changes have been made, click *Save Changes*. 
+
image::images/admin/shelving-location-order-2.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Delete Shelving Location"]
+
. Items on your xref:_pull_list_for_hold_requests[holds pull list] 
will now be listed based on this order.
