Shelving Location Editor

anchor:shelving-location-editor[Shelving Location Editor]

Library staff can create and manage shelving locations for their library or library system.

[CAUTION]
=========
If your library uses the acquisitions module and loads vendor records you MUST let your vendors
know about any changes you make to shelving location names that are used in their templates.  

The value for Name in the shelving locations editor and the value in the $l of the vendor 
MARC record template MUST match or your MARC records will not load.
=========

Go to *Administration-> Local Administration-> Shelving Locations Editor.*

Multi-branch libraries can use the library filter to adjust the scope of the shelving
locations that display.

Deleted shelving locations are filtered out by default.

[NOTE]
======
Libraries can provide Co-op Support with a list of their shelving locations translated
into French.  Co-op Support will then load the translations into Evergreen so that 
the shelving location names display in French whenever a patron views the public catalogue
in French.

Creating a Shelving Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
. Go to *Administration-> Local Administration-> Shelving Locations Editor.*
. Click *New Shelving Location*.
. Enter the relevant information for your shelving location and click *Save*.
+
* *Circulate?* means an item in this location can be checked out.
* *Checkin Alert* will prompt staff to route the item to the location when checking in items with this location.
* *Hold Capture Requires Verification*, if set up, will generate a prompt when an item is captured for a hold.
* *Holdable* means a patron is able to place a hold on an item in this location.
* *OPAC Visible* means items in the location will display in your public catalogue.
* *Label Prefix* and *Label Suffix*, if set up, will be automatically included when printing spine labels.

[NOTE]
======
Text in the Label prefix and Label suffix fields will automatically be added to
spine labels printed for items in the selected shelving location. It does not affect
public catalogue or staff client display.
======

[TIP]
=====
Whether an item can be circulated, is holdable, or visible on the OPAC, is
controlled by three factors: item status, shelving location, and item attributes
(the options in the Holdings Editor). Evergreen follows the aforementioned sequence 
to check the value of each factor until it encounters a NO. An item can be circulated,
holdable or visible on OPAC when all three factors are set to YES.

. Make your changes and click *Save*.



Deleting a Shelving Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shelving locations that are no longer needed can only be deleted if they contain no 
un-deleted items.  

Before attempting to delete a shelving location Co-op Support recommends running a report using 
the Sitka template _Shelving Location : Item with Selected Shelving Location_ to 
check for any un-deleted items.

. Go to *Administration-> Local Administration-> Shelving Locations Editor.*
. Select the shelving location you wish to delete.
. From the *Actions* menu selected *Delete Selected*.
+

+
. _Is Deleted?_ will have a value of _Yes_ for the shelving location and it will be filtered
out of the list by default.

[NOTE]
======
Deleted shelving locations are filtered out of the grid by default. You can adjust the 
filter to see deleted shelving locations as needed.

Because deleted shelving locations also display in the reporter Co-op Support recommends renaming 
deleted shelving locations to start with Z.  Deleted shelving locations
will then sort alphabetically to the bottom of the list and it is very evident when running 
reports that filter on shelving location which shelving locations in the list are deleted.

Libraries can specify the order shelving locations should appear on the 
xref:_pull_list_for_hold_requests[holds pull list].

Ordering the shelving locations so that locations that are physically close to 
each other appear together on the list can make it easier for staff pulling holds.

. Go to *Administration-> Local Administration-> Shelving Locations Order.*
. Select the shelving location you would like to re-order.
. Use the arrow buttons to move the location up or down the list, or move it to the top or bottom
of the list. 
+

. Once all changes have been made, click *Save Changes*. 
+
image::images/admin/shelving-location-order-2.png[scaledwidth="75%",alt="Delete Shelving Location"]
+
. Items on your xref:_pull_list_for_hold_requests[holds pull list] 
will now be listed based on this order.
