Statistical Categories - Item Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Statistical categories, often referred to as stat cats, allow your library to capture information
about your items that is not included in the standard fields in the item record.  Statistical
categories can be created at the branch, system, or federation level by staff with the 
appropriate permissions.

Item statistical categories can be used in reporting and OPAC visible stat cats display in
your public catalogue.

See xref:_item_statistical_category_values[] for information on applying statistical categories

Patron statistical categories can be used in reporting and can be set to display to library
