This is where you configure your statistical categories (stat cats).  Stat cats are a way to save and report on additional information that does not fit elsewhere in Evergreen's default records.  It is possible to have stat cats for copies or patrons.

. Select *Administration -> Local Administration-> Statistical Categories Editor*.

. To create a new stat cat, enter the name of the stat cat and select *Copy* or *Patron* in the dropdown menu. Check the respective *On* or *Off* radio buttons beside each option, and click *Create new statistical category*.
+
*OPAC Visibility*: If On, the stat cat and its value are displayed in Copy Details on OPAC.
** This feature is not working. The stat cat and its value will not be displayed in the OPAC.
+
*Required*: If On, the stat cat becomes mandatory.
+
*Archive with Circs*: If On, the stat cat and its value are kept in aged circulation records.

*Patron stat cats*: Below are some examples of patron stat cats.  Patron stat cats can be used to keep track of information like the high school a patron attends, or the home library for a consortium patron, e.g. InterLink. You would see these in the lower part of the registration/edit patron screen.

There are two more options when creating a patron stat cat: *Allow Free Text* allows staff to type in the values when on patron registration/edit screen; *Show in Summary* displays the stat cat in patron summary.

This is what the patron stat cat looks like in the patron registration screen.
