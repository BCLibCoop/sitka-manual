Statistical Categories Editor: Items and Patrons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

anchor:stat-cat[Statistical Category Editor]

This is where you configure your statistical categories (Stat Cats).  
Stat cats allow your library  to set up locally defined statistical categories for items or patrons. These statistical categories can then be applied when adding patrons or cataloguing items, to generate reports on usage. Each stat cat has specific values attached, and you add them once you have created the stat cat itself, as described below.

As of Evergreen 3.11, the Statistical Categories Editor is split into two interfaces, one for items and one for patrons.

Statistical Categories Editor: Items

*OPAC Visibility*: If selected, the stat cat and its value are displayed in Item Details on the OPAC.

*Required*: If selected, the stat cat becomes mandatory when cataloguing a new item.

Statistical Categories Editor: Patrons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Patron stat cats*: Below are some examples of patron stat cats.  Patron stat cats can be used to keep track of information like the high school a patron attends, or other required information. You would see these in the lower part of the registration/edit patron screen.

. Select *Administration -> Local Administration-> Statistical Categories Editor - Patron*.

. Click *New Statistical Category Editor- Patron* to open the editor.

. Enter the name of the stat cat. Select the respective check boxes for each option as required, and click *Save*.

There are two more options when creating a patron stat cat:

*Allow Free Text* allows staff to type in a value when on patron registration/edit screen, not just select from defined entries.

*Show in Summary* displays the stat cat on the patron summary screen.

. To add stat cat values, click *Entries* in the line of the stat cat.  

. Click *New Statistical Category Entry - Patron* to open the editor. Enter required value and click *Save*. Repeat for each required value.

. Once you have entered all the values needed, click *Return* at top right of screen to go back to the previous screen.

This is what the patron stat cat looks like on the patron registration screen.
