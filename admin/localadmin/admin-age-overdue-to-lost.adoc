Age Overdue Circs to Lost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _Age Overdue Circs to Lost_ feature allows you to create a queue of items to be marked lost. *ALL* overdue items by selected patron profiles at selected libraries will be marked Lost.

[NOTE]
This feature does not support a date parameter. *ALL* overdue items by selected patron profiles at selected libraries will be marked Lost. It is mainly for school libraries' end of term process. To automatically mark items lost when they are overdue for x days, contact Co-op support.
