In Evergreen unfillable holds are called Hopeless Holds.  A hold will become hopeless when all of the 
items that could potentially fill the hold are in a hopeless prone item status or all potential items have 
been deleted from the database.

The hopeless prone item statuses in Sitka's Evergreen are _Discard/Weed_, _Damaged_, _Lost_, _Lost and Paid_, 
and _Missing_.  This is set globally and cannot be altered for individual libraries.

Libraries should review and resolve hopeless holds on a regular basis.

. Click  *Administration → Local Administration → Hopeless Holds.*
. A list of holds that are considered unfulfillable is generated.

. From the *Actions* menu select:
.. *xref:_cancelling_holds[Cancel Hold]* to cancel the patron's hold.
.. *xref:_transferring_title_holds[Transfer to Marked Title]* to move the hold to a record with holdable items.
.. *xref:add_holdings[Add Holdings]* to add a new item to the record.  This can be temporary on order item 
while your library waits for a replacement to arrive.
.. *http://docs.libraries.coop/acquisitions/_add_line_items.html#_place_orderView/Place Orders]* to add a line item to a selection list or purchase order.  This will only work for 
libraries using the acquisitions module.

[CAUTION]
=========
If you participate in reciprocal borrowing, make sure you have _Requesting Library_ as a column.

If you are cancelling the hold and the requesting library is not your library this means it is an 
Interlibrary Connect hold that the patron chose to pick up at your library.  Your library had the last 
item that could have filled the hold so in this case you need to contact the patron or their home library 
to let them know the Interlibrary Connect hold will not be filled.
