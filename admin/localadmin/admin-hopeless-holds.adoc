In Evergreen unfillable holds are called Hopeless Holds.  A hold will become hopeless when all of the 
items that could potentially fill the hold are in a hopeless prone item status or all potential items have 
been deleted from the database.

The hopeless prone item statuses in Sitka's Evergreen are _Discard/Weed_, _Damaged_, _Lost_, _Lost and Paid_, 
and _Missing_.  This is set globally and cannot be altered for individual libraries.

Libraries should review and resolve hopeless holds on a regular basis.

. Click  *Administration → Local Administration → Hopeless Holds.*
. A list of holds that are considered unfulfillable is generated.

. From the *Actions* menu select:
.. *xref:_cancelling_holds[Cancel Hold]* to cancel the patron's hold.
.. *xref:_transferring_title_holds[Transfer to Marked Title]* to move the hold to a record with holdable items.
.. *xref:add_holdings[Add Holdings]* to add a new item to the record.  This can be temporary on order item 
while your library waits for a replacement to arrive.
.. *http://docs.libraries.coop/acquisitions/_add_line_items.html#_place_order[View/Place Orders]* to add a line item to a selection list or purchase order.  This will only work for 
libraries using the acquisitions module.

[NOTE]
======
The Hopeless Holds interface displays holds where your library is the pickup library.  Multi-branch libraries
may wish to adjust the scope to see their whole system.

Libraries participating in interlibrary connect may see holds on your
hopeless holds list for titles you've never had in your collection.  These are interlibrary connect
holds that can no longer be filled by any other library in your zone.  Libraries can decide whether to
purchase the title, try to fill the hold via your external provincial ILL system, or simply cancel the hold.
