Group Penalty Thresholds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((location administration, Circulation limit)))

Group penalty thresholds block circulation for users who exceed maximum fine limits, check out 
limits, number of overdue items, and number of lost items. Settings for your library are visible 
under *Administration -> Local Administration-> Group Penalty Thresholds*. There are four penalties 
in use now.


* PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES:	Blocks new circulations, renewals, and placing of holds if patron exceeds X in fines
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_OVERDUE_COUNT:	Blocks new circulations, renewals, and placing of holds if patron 
exceeds X overdue items
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_CHECKOUT_COUNT: Blocks new circulations if patron exceeds X items out
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_LOST_COUNT: Blocks new circulations, renewals, and placing of holds if patron 
exceeds X lost items

[NOTE]
======
Other penalties are not used by Sitka.

Accounts that meet or exceed penalty thresholds display an alert message when opened and require 
staff overrides for blocked transactions.  See xref:_system_generated_notes[] for information
on how this displays in a patron account.

Group penalty thresholds may be set up on different levels in terms of patron profiles and libraries. 
Penalties on more specific levels of profile and/or library take precedence. This allows 
you to set up penalties on a higher level of profile, e.g. Public Library Patrons, and/or library, 
e.g. system instead of branch, for most profiles and/or branches to share. If there 
are rules applied to lower level profiles, e.g. PL Juvenile or a branch, you just need to set 
them up for these specific profile/branch.

There are default penalty thresholds set at the Sitka level.  All four penalties have a threshold of 
9999. These thresholds apply if there isn't a more specific penalty set for a library.
