(((location administration, circulation limit)))
Group Penalty Thresholds block circulation transactions for users who exceed maximum check out limits, number of overdue items, or fines. Settings for your library are visible under Administration -> Local Administration-> Group Penalty Thresholds. There are four penalties in use now.


* PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES:	Blocks new circulations and renewals if patron exceeds X in fines
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_OVERDUE_COUNT:	Blocks new circulations if patron exceeds X overdue items
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_CHECKOUT_COUNT:	Blocks new circulations if patron exceeds X items out
* PATRON_EXCEEDS_LOST_COUNT:	Blocks new circulations if patron exceeds X lost items

Accounts that meet or exceed penalty thresholds display an alert message when opened and require staff overrides for blocked transactions.
