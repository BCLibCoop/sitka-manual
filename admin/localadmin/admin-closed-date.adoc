These dates are in addition to your regular weekly closed days 
(see xref:_library_hours_of_operation[]).   Both regular closed days and those entered 
in the Closed Dates Editor affect due dates, fines, and targeting for holds.

NOTE: The due date for daily loans will fall on a day marked partially closed.

Entering Closed Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enter closed dates:

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Closed Date Editor*.

+
. By default the Library field is populated with the workstation's location.  
.. Multi-branch libraries must set closed dates at the branch level.  This can be done individually by branch or 
by setting *Library* to the system level organizational unit and then checking the box for _Apply to all 
of my libraries_ to apply the closing to all branches.
+
.  Select the type of closing from the drop down menu.
.. One Full Day - use for single day closure.
.. Multiple Days - use for closures spanning more than one day.
.. Detailed - use for closures involving a partial day closure.
+
. Depending on the closing type enter the required dates and time.
+
. Enter the reason for the closing.
. Click *OK*.
+

. The closed date displays in the grid and will also display in the 
xref:_upcoming_closures[Upcoming Closures] section of the 
xref:_public_catalogue_library_info[Library Information] page on your public catalogue.


NOTE: The closed period is your local time.

Emergency Closing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your library needs to close unexpectedly it is important to enter the closure as an emergency
closure to alert patrons and reduce staff workload.

When an emergency closing is processed due dates are adjusted to fall on the day they would have
had the closing been in place at the time of check out; hourly loans have their due date adjusted to the
end of the day following the closing.  Depending on a library's settings any fines acrrued
doing the closing may be voided.  Notification emails will be sent to patrons to alert them to
the change in due date.

NOTE: The notification email is a global email and cannot be customized for individual libraries.

The section http://docs.libraries.coop/policy/_temporary_library_closures.html[Temporary Library Closures]
contains additional recommendations from Co-op Support for libraries having to close unexpectedly.

Adding an Emergency Closing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Closed Date Editor*.
. Click *Add Closing*
. Fill out the top section of the form as you would for a regular closed date.
. Check the box for _Emergency_.
. Check the box for _Process immediately_.
+

Editing an Emergency Closure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your emergency closure needs to be extended past the original end date you must add a
new emergency closing in order to move your due dates ahead again.  In this circumstance 
do not edit the existing closure.

If your library re-opens earlier than expected you need to edit the End date for your closure 
to be the last day you were actually closed on.  This is important as otherwise Evergreen still
thinks the library is closed and some functions, like hold targetting, may not behave as expected.

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Closed Date Editor*.
. Select the applicable closure and from the *Actions* menu choose *Edit Closing*.
. Edit the _End_ date to be the final day you were closed.
