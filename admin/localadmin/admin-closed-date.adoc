These dates are in addition to your regular weekly closed days (see xref:operation-hour[]).   Both regular closed days and those entered in the Closed Dates Editor affect due dates, fines, and targeting for holds.

NOTE: The due date for daily loans will fall on a day marked partially closed.

. By default the Library field is populated with the workstation's location.  
.. Multi-branch libraries must set closed dates at the branch level.  This can be done individually by branch or 
by setting *Library* to the system level organizational unit and then checking the box for _Apply to all 
of my libraries_ to apply the closing to all branches.
+
.  Select the type of closing from the drop down menu.
.. One Full Day - use for single day closure.
.. Multiple Days - use for closures spanning more than one day.
.. Detailed - use for closures involving a partial day closure.
+
. Depending on the closing type enter the required dates and time.
+
. Enter the reason for the closing.
+
. Click *OK*.

Emergency Closing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an emergency closing is processed due dates are adjusted to fall on the day they would have
had the closing been in place at the time of check out; hourly loans have their due date adjusted to the
end of the day following the closing.  Depending on a library's settings any fines acrrued
doing the closing may be voided.  Notification emails will be sent to patrons to alert them to
the change in due date.

NOTE: The notification email is a global email and cannot be customized for individual libraries.

To enter an emergency closing:

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Closed Date Editor*.
. Click *Add Closing*
. Fill out the top section of the form as you would for a regular closed date.
. Check the box for _Emergency_.
. Check the box for _Process immediately_ if you are ready to have the system process
the closing
