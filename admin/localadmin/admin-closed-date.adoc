Closed Date Editor

anchor:closed-date-editor[Closed Date Editor]

These dates are in addition to your regular weekly closed days (see xref:operation-hour[]).   Both regular closed days and those entered in the Closed Dates Editor affect due dates, fines, and targeting for holds.

NOTE: The due date for daily loans will fall on a day marked partially closed.

 multiple branches can switch this to their system level organizational unit and then check
the box for _Apply to all of my libraries_ to apply the closing to the whole system.

.. One Full Day - use for single day closure.

NOTE: The closed period is your local time.

Emergency Closing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Closures can be applied retroactively if the library has to close unexpectedly.

When an emergency closing is processed due dates are adjusted to fall on the day they would have
had the closing been in place at the time of check out; hourly loans have their due date adjusted to the
end of the day following the closing.  Depending on a library's settings any fines acrrued 
doing the closing may be voided.  Notification emails will be sent to patrons to alert them to 
the change in due date.

To enter an emergency closing:

. Go to *Administration -> Local Administration -> Closed Date Editor*. 
. Click *Add Closing* 
. Fill out the top section of the form as you would for a regular closed date.
. Check the box for _Emergency_.
. Check the box for _Process immediately_ if you are ready to have the system process 
the closing

closing falls in the past you may need to update the date in the date filter to see it.
