Call Number Prefix and Suffix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[prefix_and_suffix]

If you library uses prefixes and/or suffixes in call numbers, you can build a standard list, which 
will be displayed as dropdown lists when creating/editing call number record.

This is how it looks on the call number creating/editing screen.
