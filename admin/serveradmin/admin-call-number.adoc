Call Number Prefix and Suffix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



If you library uses prefixes and/or suffixes in call numbers, you can build a standard list, which will be displayed as dropdown lists when creating/editing call number record.

This is how it looks on the call number creating/editing screen.

Click New Prefix (Suffix). Type in the label. Choose your library as the Owning Library, and then Save.

To delete a prefix/suffix, check the record, and then click Delete Selected.

TIP: Call Number Prefix/Suffix created here are different from Label Prefix/Suffix created on Copy Location Editor. The former are displayed as part of call number in OPAC, while the latter are on printed labels only.
