Circulation Modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circulation modifiers are labels that can be assigned to items that Evergreen uses in conjunction 
with circulation policies and hold policies to determine how items should behave.  Circulation modifiers
can also be used in reports for statistical purposes.

This list includes the circulation modifiers recommended for use by Co-op Support.  

[NOTE]
====
 We recommend libraries choose a subset of these circulation modifiers to use and ensure all 
cataloguing staff are aware of the modifiers used at their library.

Co-op Support has an on-going project to streamline the list of circulation modifiers available.  
Circulation modifiers that specify a loan duration are on the list to remove as they are misleading since
on its own a circulation modifier does not have a loan period.
