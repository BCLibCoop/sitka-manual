Circulation Modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Circulation modifiers are labels that can be assigned to items that Evergreen uses in conjunction 
with xref:_circulation_policies[circulation policies] and xref:_hold_policies[hold policies] to determine 
how items should behave.  Circulation modifiers can also be used in reports for statistical purposes.

Co-op Support has an on-going project to streamline the list of circulation modifiers available as the same lists
displays to all libraries.  The list below is those modifiers recommended for use by Co-op Support.  
Modifiers available in Evergreen but not on the list will eventually be removed.

[NOTE]
======
We recommend libraries choose a subset of these circulation modifiers to use and ensure all 
cataloguing staff are aware of the modifiers used at their library.

When you start using a new circulation modifier for items Evergreen will use your default circulation 
policy when checking out the item.  Contact https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] to update your 
xref:_changing_your_circulation_policies[circulation policies] if the items should follow a more specific 
policy.
