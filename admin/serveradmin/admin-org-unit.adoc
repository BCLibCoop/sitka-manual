Library Hours of Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local system administrators can add or update the library's hours of operation on the _Hours of Operation_

+
. Evergreen will use this information when calculating due dates, overdue fines, and whether or not
to target an item for a hold.  This information will also display in your public catalogue.

[NOTE]
======
Hours of operation and xref:closed-date-editor[closed dates] affect due dates, overdue fines, and hold 
targeting.

* Due dates: Due dates that would fall on closed days are automatically pushed forward to the next open day.

* Overdue fines: Overdue fines are not charged on days when the library is closed unless the library
setting _Charge fines on overdue circulations when closed_ is set to TRUE.

* Hold Targeting: Items at a closed library will not be targeted for holds unless the library setting
_Target copies for a hold even if copy's circ lib is closed_ or _Target copies for a hold even if 
copy's circ lib is closed IF the circ lib is the hold's pickup lib_ is set to TRUE.  
======

Library Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local system administrators can add or update the library's addresses on the _Addresses_ tab. Multi-branch 
libraries should enter information at the branch level.

. Enter or update the information on the applicable subtabs on the _Addresses_ tab.
. Ensure _Is Valid?_ is checked for all valid addresses.
. Click *Save*.
+

+
. Repeat for additional subtabs.
. Evergreen will use this information on hold slips, hold transit slips, in notifications sent to patrons,
and in your public catalogue.  Libraries should ensure information is entered for all four address types as
Evergreen uses different addresses for different functions.

[CAUTION]
=========
The value in the _State_ (Province) field on the _Mailing Address_ subtab MUST be set to BC for BC libraries, MB for Manitoba 
libraries, and ON for Ontario libraries.  This field is used to generate the URL in email notifications
to take patrons to My Account in your public catalogue>  If the province is not entered correctly
the links sent to your patrons in your email notifications will not work.
