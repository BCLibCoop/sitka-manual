NOTE: The Organizational Units screen flashes green when saving changes to any tab. If there is no flash or flash in red, please ensure you are using an LSA login and click Save again. Contact Co-op support if you still cannot save the changes.



Library Hours of Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local System Administrators can use the Organizational Units interface to set the library's hours of operation. These are regular weekly hours; holiday and other closures are recorded in the Closed Dates Editor.

Hours of operation and closed dates affect due dates and overdue fines.

* Due dates. Due dates that would fall on closed days are automatically pushed forward to the next open day.

* Overdue fines. Overdue fines are not charged on days when the library is closed.

To review or edit your library's hours of operation:


Library Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Addresses set in Organizational Units appear in patron email notifications, hold slips, and transit slips. Local System Adminstrators should ensure that the Mailing, Holds, and Physical addresses are set correctly.


. Open the Organizational Units interface. Click the *Addresses* tab.

. There are four address tabs: Mailing, Holds, Physical, and ILL. Co-op support recommends setting the first three at a minimum. The Holds Address appears on hold transit slips when items are sent to fulfill holds at another branch. The Mailing address is used in notices.

. Click *Save* to record changes for each tab.

CAUTION: The value in *State* (Province) field in Mailing address is used to generate the URLs to My Account link in email notices. To ensure correct URLs, please always use BC for BC libraries or MB for Manitoba libraries.

[NOTE]
======

. You may ignore the alert in *Zip* field. The value will be saved.
. The Valid checkbox is an optional setting that does not affect current Evergreen functions, but the Sitka Support team recommends checking it for all correct addresses.
