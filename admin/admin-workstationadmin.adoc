. Log out of the staff client.
. Clear your browser cache.  See xref:_clear_cache[].
. Log into the staff client.  The full library name will now display in the library selector drop down.

[NOTE]
======
This setting only applies to library selectors written in angular code, such as the staff catalogue.  Library
selectors in older interfaces, such as most of circulation, will not show the full name.

Libraries can expect to see this setting apply to more interfaces in the future as the older parts of the 
staff client are re-written in the newer code.

Search Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[workstation-search-preferences]]

Staff should not use the search preferences settings found in Workstation Administration.  Instead
search preferences should be set from within the staff catalogue.  See xref:_search_preferences[].
